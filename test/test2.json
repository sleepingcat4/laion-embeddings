{'inputs': ['OPINIONRABINOWITZ Chief JusticeI INTRODUCTIONThis appeal and crossappeal arise out of the relative contractual and fiduciary duties of C Harold Wirum and Larry Cash past partners in the architectural firm of Wirum  Cash ArchitectsII FACTSC Harold Wirum and Larry Cash executed a written agreement on or about December 31 1982 forming the partnership of Wirum and Cash Architects W  C At that time Wirum had been a practicing architect for approximately thirty years Cash had been employed by Wirum for six years as an architect at Harold Wirum  Associates HWAWirum had a 75 ownership interest in W  C and Cash had a 25 interest Cash agreed to pay 250000 for his interest he was to pay this amount from his share of the profits of the partnership pursuant to a buyin agreement Specifically 75 of Cashs 25 share of the profits in excess of his 60000 per year draw were to be applied to reduce the buyin obligation The remaining amount was income for Cash Cash agreed to pay interest on the unpaid balance of the 250000 at the prime rate plus 2Pursuant to the partnership agreement the initial working capital of the partnership was 150000 Each partners capital account consisted of his initial capital contribution increased by any additional capital contributions made The agreement provided to the extent that a partner contributes more than his percentage of the profits to the capital he shall be entitled at the end of each year to receive interest computed monthly upon the excess capital contribution in an amount calculated by using the prime rate of interest plus 2Wirum was designated managing partner and had exclusive authority to manage and control all phases of the business As such Wirum delegated responsibility to his wife Mary Lou Wirum Mary Lou Wirum supervised the business and accounting functions of W  C She had done the same at HWAOn January 6 1986 Wirum gave Cash notice of his retirement effective July 1986 Cash was informed by his attorney that the partnership owed Wirum 15 million from the partnership assets under the retirement provisions of the partnership agreement On March 3 1986 Mary Lou Wirum gave both Wirum and Cash a memorandum indicating that Cash also had a negative capital account of approximately 85000 Cash understood that this amount had to be paid within sixty days of Wirums effective retirement The memorandum also informed Cash that he still owed all of the 250000 against the buyin plus approximately 72000 in interest Moreover it stated that W  C owed Wirum 210304 for interest on capital contributions that Wirum had lent to the firm Cash also understood that Wirum would be entitled to 75 of the accounts receivable and work in progress as of the day of retirement within thirty days of receipt thereof Moreover under Paragraph 27 of the partnership agreement Wirum was entitled to receive the credit balance of his capital account which was 11326125 within sixty days of retirementCash claims he relied upon the accuracy of the information provided to him by Mary Lou Wirum in the March 3 1986 memorandum and concluded it would be a financial hardship if not an impossibility to make the payments demanded Therefore on March 24 1986 Cash gave notice of his withdrawal from the partnership effective May 31 1986 When asked at trial why he decided to withdraw Cash statedBecause  nothing in the partnership had worked and the information that Id been  provided by Harold or Mary Lou indicated that  I had a substantial negative capital account of about 85000 that I owed 250000 of the principal on the buyin and another 72000 in interest that  the firm owed Harold 210000 in interest accrued for loans that he had made to the firm and  in addition to all of those things the commitments required by Harolds retirement was added to it It was sort of like a black hole  that had started from the  day that I became a partner until the day that I left I continued to work harder and harder and go further and further into the hole and this was the only way that I could see to stop that So I made the decision to withdrawWirum then told Cash that the partnership elected to make Cashs withdrawal effective March 31 1986The partnership agreement contained a noncompetition clause After Cash left the firm during the clauses two year period he submitted bids and obtained work from the Corps of Engineers a client of W  C at the time of withdrawal for a fee of 400000 He also solicited work from the Corps for a project valued at 510 million although he was not awarded that contract until after the noncompetition clause expired The US Postal Service also hired Cash for a fee of 200000 during the clauses effectOn December 11 1986 Wirum and W  C instituted suit against Cash requesting inter alia that Cashs accounts be charged with all paid as well as accrued but unpaid operating expenses but not credited with any accrued but uncollected accounts receivable for work in progress Wirum and W  C also requested judgment of 15646584 for money owed to Wirum given Cashs negative balance in his capital drawing accounts Thereafter Cash filed a lawsuit against Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum He alleged inter alia breach of contract breach of contract for improper maintenance of partnership books fraud negligent misrepresentation breach of fiduciary duty breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing that the partnership agreement should be rescinded given misrepresentations of Wirums prior earnings and that the noncompetition clause was void and unenforceable as a covenant restricting competitionSubsequently on March 12 1987 Wirum also filed for declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction relating to the enforcement of the noncompetition clause A preliminary injunction was granted enjoining Cash from competing in violation of the noncompetition clause However the court did not enjoin Cash in relation to an initial term of an extant contract with the US Post Office nor for the 400000 contract with the US Corps of Engineers because Wirum did not submit qualifications for either of those contracts and the contracts were to be completed in approximately three monthsThe matters then proceeded to trial without a jury Prior to final argument Cash moved to expunge part of Paragraph 27 of the partnership agreement The relevant portion states that a withdrawing partner is liable for all items of accrued expense and prepaid expenses The Wirums opposed the motion as untimely and requested that they be allowed to submit further opposition memoranda if the court was to consider Cashs motionThereafter the court issued its decision finding numerous breaches of fiduciary duty by WirumThis court concludes that the evidence at trial established that Wirum breached his fiduciary duty to Cash by treating the partnership as his private entity and not as a partnership by his failure to ensure that the books of W  C were properly and accurately maintained by permitting the commingling of W  C and Wirum personal funds by permitting prepayment in 1982 of 1983 expenses without benefit or justification by permitting W  C to pay without Cashs knowledge a personal expenses such as the fees to attorney McLaughlin and accountant Lind for advice on the partnership agreement b payment of accountant fees for personal financial advice permitting the manipulation of expenses and income at yearend 1983 and 1984 by permitting unsupported excessive and unreasonable interest to be assessed on purported loans from the Wirums to W  C and the payment thereof permitted overpayment of monies to HWA for accounts receivable permitting the underpayment of labor costs for work done by W  C on Wirums personal apartment projects and the nonpayment of overhead costs attributable thereto by not devoting fulltime and attention to W  C in 1983 1984 and 1985 by permitting W  C bookkeepers to devote an excessive amount of time to the activities of the Wirum personal business entities and by permitting the deposit of W  C funds into a Wirum personal money market account and not crediting the interest earned to W  CThe superior court expunged the disputed portion of Paragraph 27 finding it an unenforceable penalty clause In the Wirums favor the superior court concluded that Cash was not entitled to rescission of the partnership agreement as he had an adequate remedy at law that Cash violated the noncompetition clause by contracting with the US Corps of Engineers for the 400000 project and that the covenant not to compete did not violate public policyThe superior court also awarded damages to both parties Wirum recovered 99962 and Cash 118447 netting Cash 18485 Wirums award was composed of 50000 for the profit Cash made on the Corps of Engineers contract which violated the noncompetition covenant 10112 which was 25 of W  C accounts payable as of March 31 1986 and 39850 which was Cashs negative balance on his W  C capital account as of March 31 1986 Cashs award was composed of 5000 which was 25 of 20000 in payments incorrectly made to Wirum and his personal entity by W  C 44681 which was 25 of the accounts receivable as of March 31 1986 21285 which was 25 of 1986 prepaid liability and workers compensation insurance and 47481 which was the sum Cash paid Wirum under the buyin agreementCash was also awarded 19779 in prejudgment interest 146400 in Civil Rule 82 attorneys fees and 3952628 in Civil Rule 79 costs Cashs total judgment was for 20570528 Wirum and his wife Mary Lou Wirum were held jointly and severally liable for this amount This appeal and cross appeal followedBased upon our review of the record and the parties arguments we have concluded principal holdings only 1 That the superior courts findings of fact concerning the following matters are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous a Wirums breaches of his fiduciary duties b loans made by Wirum to Wirum  Cash c prepayments yearend accounting and tax reporting d commingling by Wirum e misrepresentations by Wirum f damages awarded to Cash with the exception of one element of damages which is remanded for clarification 2 That the question of the enforceability of paragraph 27 should be remanded for a determination as to whether Wirums breaches excused performance by Cash in the event the superior court determines that Cash is not excused the superior court is to hold a hearing as to whether paragraph 27 constitutes a penalty clause and is therefore unenforceable 3 That the issue of the enforceability of the noncompete clause should be remanded for determination as to whether Wirums breaches excused performance by Cash and 4 That Mary Lou Wirum is jointly and severally liable for any damages that are awarded to CashIII THE CONTROLLING FINDINGS OF FACTa Findings Relating to Breaches of Fiduciary DutiesWirum claims that the superior courts findings regarding numerous breaches of fiduciary duty by him lack the requisite evidentiary support The following relevant findings were made by the superior court and on the basis of our review of the record we conclude that they have adequate evidentiary support and thus are not clearly erroneous1 After the partnership was formed and unbeknownst to Cash the fees for Wirums attorney  in the amount of 2088602 and for his accountant  in the amount of 2978 for legal and accounting advice that Wirum received prior to the partnership agreement being signed by the parties were paid by Wirum out of the partnership instead of from personal funds2 At the time of the formation of the Wirum  Cash partnership  Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum had very substantial investments under a number of separate entities in addition to their interest in HWA The Wirums personal entities were managed out of the offices of W  C using W  C personnel and facilities  Bookkeepers for W  C were responsible for the books of up to 13 different entities of the Wirums Mary Lou Wirum represented to Cash that work performed by the bookkeepers for the Wirum personal business entities  required only a few hours a week The time required  was far in excess of a few hours a week Bookkeepers Ms Swartzbacker and Ms Ward estimated that 75 of their time was devoted to Wirum personal matters Ms Barfus estimated that 85 of her time was spent on Wirum personal matters Ms Pitka estimated that her time was divided approximately 80 for Wirum entities Ms Posey spent 60 to 70 of her time on the Wirum entities Ms Adams devoted almost her full time to Wirum personal matters3 Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum managed W  C as though it was one of their personallyowned entities FJunds of W  C were commingled with the personal funds or funds of HWA4 Mary Lou Wirum  ordered accounting staff that any income received by W  C which was not immediately needed by W  C be deposited in an account with Merrill Lynch owned by Mary Lou and Harold Wirum The interest earned on W  C funds in the Merrill Lynch account was not credited to W  C5 In late December 1982 HWA prepaid expenses for 1983 totalling 10396134 This prepayment of expenses created the need for W  C to borrow money from the Wirums At the direction of Mary Lou Wirum the prepaid expense cost of 10396134 was repaid to the Wirums by W  C during February and March 1983 Mary Lou Wirum also assessed W  C interest at a prime rate plus 2 for the amount of the prepaid expense6 The W  C financial records included numerous Due ToDue From accounts attributable to the Wirums personal business entities and the Wirums personal activities A Due From account is like an accounts receivable account or a loan account It means that money is owed by some entity or person As a loan a due from as used by W  C was without interest7 W  C recorded on its books some monies received on accounts receivable of HWA In the course of this process monies which should have been credited only to W  C were in fact credited back to HWA This error amounted to approximately 13561 not being credited as income to Cash8 Income to HWA for accounts receivable outstanding as of January 1 1983 received in 1983 were deposited in W  C bank accounts the total amount of 934532 was credited to Wirum as contributions to W  C These contributions were not reasonably necessary to meet the operating capital needs of W  C in 1983 and such amounts were  withdrawn by the Wirums andor their entities for their personal use9 In December 1983 at Mary Lou Wirums direction a 75000 W  C check was made payable to ML Wirum Inc This payment had nothing to do with W  C but was recorded as a Due From HWA in the W  C books10 For tax purposes Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum were seeking to shelter as much income as they could for the year 1983 Accordingly they had a vested personal interest in manipulating the income and expenses of W  C to ensure a reported tax loss At year end 1984 Mary Lou Wirum directed that W  C withhold reporting income received and further directed that income be reported as received in January 1985 The effect of the 1984 yearend manipulation of expenses and income was to materially distort the income of W  C This in turn distorted the payment which otherwise would have been made by Cash under the BuyIn Agreement and the W  C capital accounts for Wirum and Cash11During 1983 and 1984 the Wirums as the sole partners in a partnership known as the 500 Group built two apartment projects at Anchorage Mary Lou Wirum as president of ML Wirum Inc acted as construction manager for the apartment projects W  C provided the architectural services for the apartment projects and Wirum acted as project manager for W  C for the Apartment Projects W  C paid the wages of W  C employees who performed work on the apartment projects in 1983 and 1984 W  C also paid consultant bills of approximately 181436 for work done on the apartment projects At yearend 1983 consultant expenses incurred by W  C were recorded as  Due From HWA Construction  At yearend 1983 some labor costs incurred by W  C during 1983 for work done on the apartment projects were recorded as  Due from HWA Construction  During 1983 and 1984 bills for third party clients of W  C were reviewed on a monthly basis at meetings usually attended by Wirum Cash and a bookkeeper The Wirums apartment projects were not discussed at the W  Cs monthly billing meetings The Wirums did not recognize charge or pay any overhead cost attributable to work performed by W  C on the apartment projects owned by the WirumsBy W  C paying the consultant fees and additional labor costs incurred by W  C for work done on the apartment projects as Due From entries without any interest charged to those amounts the Wirums took interest free loans from W  C to finance the architectural costs of the apartment projects These interest free loans were taken throughout 1983 and 1984 and into 198512The records for W  C understated the direct labor costs incurred by W  C for work done on the apartment projects in 1983 and 1984 The records of W  C further failed to accurately reflect personal expenses of the Wirums paid by W  C The adjustment for 1983 is 64121 and for 1984 is 41862 reflecting additional monies owed by Wirums to W  C Hjours worked by W  C personnel on the apartment projects  were not included in the calculations of W  C for the purposes of labor costs to be reimbursed by the Wirums13 Wirum  had in 1983 and 1984 a priority with his apartment projects and as a result he could not devote his full time attention to W  C Wirum devoted a substantial amount of time to his own interests in the apartment projects14 On March 12 1986 Mary Lou Wirum directed Ms Niemann to draw a check from W  C payable to C Harold Wirum for 21029529 for purported interest owed to Wirum for loans to W  C from 1983 through 1985 Cash was not informed of this payment while he was a partner to W  Cb Findings Relating to PrePayments YearEnd Accounting and Tax ReportingOne of the specific findings of breach which Wirum challenges is the prepayment of expenses in 1982 and 1983 and the manipulation of expenses and income at yearend in 1983 and 1984 Wirum argues that the court erred in making factual findings in applying the wrong legal standard and by improperly shifting the burden of proofFirst the evidence does show that in late December 1982 Wirum permitted prepayment of W  C partnership expenses for 1983 totaling 10396134 Some of these prepayments went to the Wirums entities The prepayment of these expenses was not required and did not benefit W  C In early 1983 Wirum loaned W  C money to repay these payments Wirum charged W  C prime plus 2 per annum for the loan While W  C income was used in 1983 to repay the loan interest was allowed to accrueSecond Wirum states that Cash knew of the manipulation of the income and the prepayment of the expenses because Cash had access to the partnerships tax returns books and records A partner only overcomes a breach of fiduciary duty if there is a full and complete disclosure to the other partner and if the breaching partner secures the other partners approval and consent Skone v Quanco Farms 261 CalApp2d 237 68 CalRptr 26 29 1968 This includes a full disclosure of the fact that he or she is dealing on his or her own account and all the facts which are material to the transaction Starr v International Realty Ltd 271 Or 396 533 P2d 165 16869 1975 Consent must be informed consent with knowledge of facts necessary to an intelligent choice Id This duty of full disclosure is especially great when the breaching partner is experienced in business compared to the nonbreaching partner In re Stanton 38 BR 746 752 Bankr 9th Cir1984 appeal dismissed 766 F2d 1283 9th Cir1985In Application of Lester 87 Misc2d 717 386 NYS2d 509 SupCt1976 the question arose whether various dissenting partners ratified an agreement buying out a past partner Although the dissenting partners knew of the agreement and were silent the court held that only when the selfdealing partner speaks and the other has a duty to respond can silence be taken as assent In order for there to be a ratification or estoppel the partners need detailed knowledge so that by their silence there was acquiescence ratification or estoppel Quoting Trustees of East Hampton v Bowman 136 NY 521 32 NE 987 988 1893 the court explainedBut before a principal can be held to have ratified the unauthorized act of an assumed agent he must have full knowledge of the facts so that it can be said that he intended to ratify the act If his knowledge is partial or imperfect he will not be held to have ratified the unauthorized act and the proof of adequate knowledge of the facts should be reasonably clear and certainApplication of Lester 386 NYS2d at 514In the case at bar merely presenting the books to Cash was not sufficient especially as the information contained in them was erroneous Moreover Burke the expert accountant testified that the partnership records were very complexThis made it extremely difficult to determine the financial position of the partnership at any point in time it made it difficult to identify what was income to the partnership it made it difficult to determine what working capital was actually needed by the partnership at any point in time it made it difficult to determine what amounts were owed if any to either the Wirum entities or to Wirum  Cash at any point in timeIn fact the superior court foundbecause Wirum as the managing partner of W  C failed to assure that W  C was run as a complete and separate entity from the Wirums other 13 personal entities it became necessary for accountants for both parties to do a complex accounting reconstruction of the financial position of W  C as well as the financial status of each partner by the application of complex accounting theories principles and assumptionsHere merely presenting the books does not constitute full disclosure for an informed consent Lack of a full disclosure substantiated Cashs testimony that he did not know the interest Wirum claimed was due until he received the March 3 1986 memorandum Moreover for some improprieties such as year end manipulation of expenses the superior court found that Mary Lou represented to Cash that what had been done was what was always done was proper and was approved by their accountantsThe Wirums also argue that the superior court erroneously shifted the burden of proof and applied the wrong legal standard in judging these management decisions They claim the standard is whether such decisions were made in good faith for legitimate business reasons Cash argues that fiduciaries do not discharge their burden of proof as to the propriety of their conduct by proving a legitimate business purposeGenerally partners are not liable to the partnership for failure to use ordinary skill and care in the supervision and management of business because harm to the partnership is frequently outweighed by the need to give the partner sufficient leeway to exercise discretion on behalf of the partnership however a partner may be charged with losses resulting from acting in a selfinterested manner or in violation of the agreement Bromberg  Ribstein on Partnership  607f at 6856 Alaska recognizes the business judgement rule See Alaska Plastics Inc v Coppock 621 P2d 270 278 Alaska 1980 Betz v Chena Hot Springs Group 657 P2d 831 835 Alaska 1982In a case that involves both an exercise of the managing partners discretion and selfdealing we adopt the higher standard to judge that partners actions See Bassan v Investment Exchange Corp 83 Wash2d 922 524 P2d 233 23738 1974 The need to exercise discretion does not excuse the managing partners fiduciary duties See Labovitz v Dolan 189 IllApp3d 403 136 IllDec 780 786 545 NE2d 304 310 1989 Despite a partnership agreement giving a general partner wide discretion in deciding whether or not to distribute cash to the limited partners the general partner still owed his limited partners a fiduciary duty which necessarily encompasses the duty of exercising good faith honesty and fairness in his dealings with them and the funds of the partnership Consequently the allegation of selfdealing invokes the higher burden and it is allocated to the breaching partner Here given the litany of fiduciary breaches the superior court found the superior court did not err in its conclusion that the actions in question were taken to benefit Wirum at the expense of the partnership or Cash Therefore we hold that the allocation of the burden and the standard by which the superior court evaluated Wirums behavior was not errorc Findings Concerning Loans Made From Wirum to Wirum  CaskBurke performed a cash flow analysis showing that Wirums practices caused an unnecessary need for excess cash Burke testified that the interest legitimately owed to Wirum was 11228 for his working capital contributions in 1983 5450 for his excess capital contributions in 1983 and 816 in working capital loans in 1984 Yet the following amount of interest was calculated as being owed to Wirum for loans and excess capital contributions 4403690 in 1983 5094063 in 1984 10632571 for 1985 and 1908951 for January and February 1986 The discrepancy occurred because money received on account of HWA projects totalling 934532 was commingled with income of W  C and credited to Wirum as a contribution Therefore interest was calculated based on HWA contributions passing through the W  C accounts rather than on what was reasonably necessary to meet W  Cs operating needs Burke called these contributions unnecessary Based on income actually earned and received W  C had no need to carry loans or receive excess capital contributions from Wirum after February 1984Wirum argues that the evidence does not support a finding that excessive loans were made or that the partnership could have operated with no cash reserves Specifically Wirum argues the following that Cashs witness Burke was not qualified as a business expert but only as an auditor that Cash agreed that initial working capi tal of the partnership would be 150000 cash and that Cash acknowledged he would need operating capital in the amount of 250000 and the firms accounts receivable to continue the firm aloneWhile Wirum challenges Burkes qualifications Burke was a Price Waterhouse Certified Public Accountant The superior court accepted Burke as an expert CPA specifically to testify in areas of accounting and audit  in accounting Burke explained that one of the duties of an accountant is to advise on good business practices She provides business consulting to clients which includes cash flow managementBurke explained her methodology Burke performed a cash flow analysis examining all accounting records This included books of original entry invoices memorandums that refer to or support numbers in books of original entry and tax returns It also included the partnership agreement She completed this type of analysis for her other clients as well While she admits not having experience in running an architectural firm she could see trends within W  C itself that supported her conclusions For example in testifying that funds received at the end of 1983 were not deposited in a reasonable time she explainedbased on an analysis that I performed its clear that the receipts as recorded in the accounting records are less toward the end of a calendar year than the typical amount deposited for other months and that there are large deposits made in January Its my opinion that these funds did not they were not received in the same way they were recorded in the accounting records If you look at the deposits the income as recorded in the general ledger on a monthly basis you will see a drop in deposits toward the end of the year and a significant increase the following JanuaryThe trial involved extensive testimony by the Wirums accountants John Rothenbueler and Ron Lind as well as the testimony of Burke on Cashs behalf The amount of weight to give to a witnesses testimony is in the sound discretion of the trial court Civil Rule 52a Associated Engrs  Contractors Inc v H  W Constr Co Inc 438 P2d 224 Alaska 1968 Wirums witness Rothenbueler admitted that he did not determine whether the loans were reasonably necessary He conceded however that the bookkeepers  didnt have a good handle on what the cash balances were Burke questioned parts of Rothenbuelers analysis Overall we conclude that the superior court did not err in heavily crediting Burkes testimonyEvidence exists in the record that Wirum never determined the amount of loans reasonably required to meet W  Cs capital needs When asked if the money lent was necessary to meet the operating expenses of W  C Wirum responded that was up to the bookkeepers They had the freedom  to draw the money whenever they needed it When asked if he ever reviewed whether the bookkeepers borrowed money only when necessary to meet the partnerships operating expenses he stated I personally never did Yet neither did Mary Lou Wirum ever direct the bookkeepers to calculate loans on what was reasonably necessary for W  C to meet its operating capital needs When the 210295 check was drawn representing interest on loans from 1983 through 1985 Wirum did not try to determine if this amount was the correct amount owed to him He said This check just came in and was deposited Thats about all I can say I didnt think about it at all The superior court found this interest charge was substantially and materially erroneousd Findings Regarding ComminglingThe superior court foundThe evidence clearly established that at significant times Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum managed W  C as though it was one of their personallyowned entities instead of a completely separate partnership entity As a result funds of W  C were commingled with the personal funds or funds of HWAWirum argues that the records contained all the information needed for an accounting or an audit to be done He contends that if adequate records are kept the commingling of accounts is not a breach of contract or of fiduciary duty In our view this argument failsAs Cash argues the breach was not poor record keeping but managing the funds for Wirums own interest For example the superior court noted that Mary Lou Wirumordered accounting staff that any income received by W  C which was not immediately needed by W  C be deposited in an account with Merrill Lynch owned by Mary Lou  Harold Wirum The interest earned on W  C funds in the Merrill Lynch account was not credited to W  CSimilarly when HWA money was commingled with W  C money in 1983 it was entered as a contribution for which Wirum received interestThis type of commingling constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty See Glazer v Kurman 384 Pa 283 120 A2d 892 894 1956 Defendant kept the books of the company and he alone had the power to draw checks He mingled partnership funds and personal funds in one bank account and on this one account drew checks to pay both partnership obligations and his own personal obligations It requires no citation of authority to support the proposition that defendants conduct amounted to a breach of the fiduciary duty which one partner owes to anothere Findings Relating to MisrepresentationIn its findings of fact relating to misrepresentation the superior court statedHarold and Mary Lou Wirum represented to Cash during partnership negotiations that Harolds architectural practice had averaged a net income of 500000 during the fiveyear period 1978 through 1982 At the time of this representation both Harold and Mary Lou Wirum knew that the net income of 500000 was derived not only from Harolds architectural practice but was in fact his net income from all his entities and investmentsBased on the Wirums representations that the 500000 per year was income from Harolds architectural practice Cash proceeded with the negotiations of a buy in into the firmWirum argues that this finding caused the superior court to rescind the buyin awarding 47481 paid in under it He also argues that Cash failed to prove the elements necessary to avoid the buyin contract on the grounds of fraud or misrepresentation as the record did not support the finding that misrepresentations were made regarding the value of the business or that Cashs reliance on any such statements was reasonable Cash however argues that the trial court did not rescind the buyin or award Cash damages on his claim of negligent misrepresentationAs noted above the superior court found numerous breaches of fiduciary duties and emphasized all of them in its conclusions of law Given the purposes of our remand which is discussed below we need not reach this issue since if on remand the superior court determines that Wirums breaches of fiduciary duties were material Cash would be excused from further performance of the buyin agreementf Findings Relating to Damages Awarded CashWirum claims that he cannot tell from where the court drew its damage figures Wirum asserts therefore that the damage award cannot be adequately reviewed Wirum however does not specify any particular error Nevertheless we will briefly review the evidentiary bases for the damage findingsi5000 which is 25 of 20000 payments incorrectly made to 500 L Group and to C Harold Wirum by W  CThe 20000 in payments incorrectly made by W  C to Wirums entities was actually composed of 16000 paid to the 500 L group and 4000 paid to Wirum personally Burke found in journal entries 634 and 720 that both of these amounts receivable had been deducted from the books twice The double deductions meantas detailed on Exhibit GV we have now reduced those two accounts twice We have reduced it and zeroed it out at the end of June so that at the end of June  the general ledger showed that they entities of 500 L Group and personal did not owe any monies to the partnership of Wirum  Cash The third journal entry in fact creates an amount that the partnership owes to those entities by changing it from a receivable to a payableThis amount was then credited to the respective entities W  C was therefore due 20000 25 of which represented Cashs shareii4468100 which is 25 of accounts receivable as of March 31 1986W  C accounts receivable were 178723 as of March 31 1986 This amount was earned while Cash was a partner W  C itself provided the document from which this figure was generated Cashs award of 10112 was arrived at by deducting Cashs share of the questioned payments to consultants from his 25 share of the accounts receivable The evidence supports this offsetiii25 of 1986 prepaid liability and workers compensation insurance  Larry Cashs share of this amount is 21285The superior court stated Since W  C existed only for the first three months of 1986 Larry Cash is entitled to recover his share of prepaid liability and workers compensation insurance paid for all of 1986 For 1986 professional liability insurance cost 104172 and workers compensation insurance cost 9349 Prepaid expenses for the nine months remaining in 1986 after Cashs withdrawal amounted to 85140 for professional liability and workers compen sation insurance Twentyfive percent of 85140 amounts to 21285iv 47481 which is the sum Cash paid to Wirum under the terms of the buyin agreementCash argues he lost this amount when he forfeited his interest in the partnership due to Wirums breach of his fiduciary duties Yet the tax returns Cash and Burke cite as supporting the 47481 do not indicate that Cash paid this amount in compliance with the terms of the buyin agreement Moreover Wirum argues the math is wrong Upon remand the superior court is directed to clarify this issue by entering additional findings of fact and if necessary modified conclusions of lawIY WAS PARAGRAPH 27 AN UNENFORCEABLE PENALTY CLAUSEUpon Cashs notice of withdrawal Wirum told Cash that Cash owed 6891575 for payables accrued prior to Cashs withdrawal pursuant to Paragraph 27 On October 7 1988 after the parties had rested but before final arguments commenced Cash requested that the court find Paragraph 27s clause all items of accrued expense and prepaid expenses to be an unenforceable penalty clause Wirum opposed the motion as untimely and requested that the court allow him to address the merits with further memoranda if the court was going to consider it The superior court did not respond to the question of timeliness or allow further briefing In its findings it heldUnder the provisions of Paragraph 27 of the partnership agreement a withdrawing partner is charged with all prepaid as well as accrued but unpaid operating expenses including a proportionate share of normal fiscal yearend expenses and he is not entitled to receive any amount for accounts receivable or work in progress These provisions requiring Cash as the withdrawing 25 partner to pay all prepaid as well as accrued but unpaid operating expenses including a proportionate share of normal fiscal yearend expenses and the same time for him not to be entitled to receive any amount for accounts receivable is clearly an unenforceable penalty These contract provisions fixing damages in advance of a partners withdrawal are intended to penalize a withdrawing partner and do not constitute an enforceable liquidated damage clause Under the facts of this case where the majority and managing partner of the partnership breached his fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to a minority partner a penalty clause that has no relation to what actual losses the partnership suffered by the minority partners withdrawal is unenforceableThe superior court awarded Cash 44681 constituting 25 of the accounts receivable as of March 31 1986 and 21285 representing 25 of 1986 prepaid liability and workers compensation insurance Wirum questions the timeliness of Cashs argument the lack of an evidentiary hearing and the absence of critical findings by the courtWirum claims that Cashs motion was untimely he argues that the pleadings did not address the concept of reformation or expunging a part of the partnership agreement nor was it addressed at trial Cash responds that while he briefed the legal defense after the close of evidence the enforceability of Paragraph 27 was an issue in the pleadings and throughout the trial because the Wirums sought money damages based on Paragraph 27 We answer these contentions in alternative fashion since we have concluded that the question of the enforceability of paragraph 27 should be remanded to the superior court for additional findings of fact and conclusions of lawIt is a basic principle of contract law that a contract breach may excuse further performance On this point the superior court failed to make the necessary determinations whether under a contract analysis Wirums breaches of his fiduciary duties excused Cashs performance of his obligations under paragraph 27 Thus on remand the superior court should enter additional findings and conclusions as to whether Wirums various breaches discussed above were material breaches of the parties contract Restatement Second of Contracts  237 comment d  241 1981 Howard S Lease Constr Co v Holly 725 P2d 712 71516 Alaska 1986In the event the superior court determines that none of Wirums breaches relieved Cash of his obligations under paragraph 27 we hold that the superior court abused its discretion in refusing to allow Wirum to brief the issue of whether paragraph 27 constituted an unenforceable penalty clause and therefore should be expunged Cash did not assert in the pleadings that paragraph 27 constituted an unenforceable penalty clause Furthermore review of the record persuades us that this issue was not tried with Wirums consent This penalty clause issue was raised for the first time after Wirum had rested his case In brief Wirum was never afforded the opportunity to present countervailing evidence or to argue the matter fullyV THE NONCOMPETE CLAUSECash argues that Wirum is not entitled to enforce the noncompete clause because Wirums breaches of fiduciary duties discharged Cashs further obligations under this clauseWirum argues that he breached no duty to Cash and that any breaches were not wilful or material Wirum argues that Cash voluntarily left the firm because of the amount of money he was required to pay upon Wirums retirement and stresses that Cash received the benefits which he reasonably could have expected based on the partnership agreement Wirum also argues that Cash can be adequately compensated if a breach occurred and that Wirum will suffer an unjust and unnecessary forfeiture if Cash is excusedGiven the remand we discussed above as to the enforceability of paragraph 27 we think a similar disposition is called for as to this issue We therefore remand the question of the enforceability of the noncompete clause for the purpose of permitting the superior court to enter additional findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether Wirums breaches were material and whether such material breaches excused Cash from any obligations he had under the provisions of the noncompete clauseIn the event the superior court on remand determines that Wirums breaches did not relieve Cash of his obligations under the noncompete clause we will address the parties arguments regarding the supe rior courts rulings pertaining to the noncompete clausei Postal service contractThe superior court found Cash did not violate the noncompetition clause by entering into a contract with the United States Postal Service within two 2 years of March 31 1986 because Wirum did not submit a bid on the Postal Service contract In essence the superior court approved Judge Joan Katzs preliminary injunction refusing to enjoin Cash from completing the contract for Phase I of the project because Wirum had not attempted to obtain the contract Cash citing Data Management Inc v Greene 757 P2d 62 Alaska 1988 claims both Judge Katz and Judge Gonzalez adopted a rule of reasonableness in their interpretation of the clause He also emphasizes that these clauses are disfavored and Wirum had not submitted a bid Wirum responds however that the superior court should have looked at whether Cashs contract was with a W  C or HWA client and not whether Wirum had placed a bid on that particular contractBased on the language of the partnership agreement we conclude that Wirums argument has merit Paragraph 16 of the agreement readsNo partner shall directly or indirectly engage in competition with the business of the partnership as described in paragraph 5 If any partner withdraws or is expelled for the partnership he shall not perform services for a client of the partnership past or present or a client of Wirums architectural practice as a sole practitioner for a two year period thereafter without the consent of the other partnersA partner may engage in other enterprises which do not conflict or compete with the business or interest of the partnership and a partner need not offer such business opportunities to the partnership or the other partnersEmphasis added The US Postal Service was Cashs client as well as a former client of W  C The US Postal Service contract provided total fees of 200000 and was entered into within two years of leaving the partnership Judge Katz ruling for Wirum on the preliminary injunction acknowledged that contacts have been made which at least on the face of the noncompete agreement violate that agreement and those more specifically are the contacts and the contracts with the Postal Service and Corps of EngineersCash claims that Wirum did not submit a bid on this project Yet this factual issue is irrelevant given the plain language of the clauseii Corps of Engineers ContractCash has a contract to perform architectural services for a dining facility for the US Corps of Engineers at Fort Wainwright valued at 510 million Wirum alleges that Cash solicited work for this project during the noncompete period The Corps of Engineers was Wirums client for twenty five years including at the time Cash withdrew Wirum claims he submitted for the Corps job and was shortlisted he believed he had a good chance of getting it However the project was put on hold and Cash obtained the actual award after the two year noncompete period expired Wirum alleges that the trial court erred by not awarding damages for this breach The court made no finding as to whether this action violated the clauseCash responds that the Corps contract did not commence within the twoyear term of the noncompetition clause but six months later Cash cites Judge Katzs ruling at the preliminary injunction that the clause would only be construed to prevent Cash from competing where the effective date of any contract would fall within the twoyear period because one needs to treat such clauses restrictively See DeCristofaro v Security Natl Bank 664 P2d 167 169 Alaska 1983In our view Cash has the more persuasive position While the Corps of Engineers first solicited the statement of qualifications on the project in September 1987 and Cash submitted a bid in October 1987 Cash was only selected for the project on January 6 1988 At the date of trial August 30 1988 no negotiations had occurred no contract was signed no work was performed nor was a proposal predicate to negotiating the fee for services prepared Simply no services had been performed which is what the partnership agreement prohibitedWhile an allegation existed that collusion delayed the project Claude Vining assistant chief of the engineering division of the Alaska District Corps of Engineers testified that it was not an unusual period of time between the solicitation and selection He explained that our user the Army has not authorized us to complete the project Yining denied that the Corps and Cash agreed to delay work on the project Cash also denies itiii Contracts with the United StatesCash submitted a statement of qualifications for a US Army Corps Engineers architectural services contract and was selected for negotiations The Corps ultimately awarded him an indefinite delivery of architectural services contract He performed approximately 250000 in architectural services on the contract yet he was unable to identify his profit The superior court awarded Wirum 50000 representing the profit the court determined that Cash made on this contract Wirum testified that he also bid on this contract although conflicting evidence existedAt the preliminary injunction hearing Judge Katz allowed Cash to continue to perform the contract to its completion Judge Katz found that Wirum had not submitted qualifications for the contract and Cashs performance under it was likely to be finished in two or three months Judge Katz did not issue a preliminary injunctionMr Cash is in midstream on that job and Mr Wirum did bid on that particular option  at least he thinks he probably did That one will apparently run out at about the same time that the noncompete clause itself expires I think here because there is a potential for serious harm to Mr Cashs reputation should he effectively breach his contract by breaking it off in the middle since theres a harm to his employees potentially if this contract not be completed I am not going to enjoin him from continuing with the Corps contract for this particular yearAt trial on the merits superior court Judge Gonzalez found that Cash had violated the noncompete clause by contracting with the Corps to perform architectural services within two years of March 31 1986 for a client for whom HWA andor W  C had done work The superior court found the clause not unreasonably restrictive nor is it violative of public policyCash argues that a restraint on his ability to contract with the United States eg the Army Corps of Engineers is unreasonable because it eliminates ordinary competition as opposed to competition which would be unfair to W  C Cash emphasizes that the competitive federal proce dures for procuring architectural services existWe reject Cashs argument Cash places much emphasis on Data Management Inc v Greene 757 P2d 62 Alaska 1988 First Data Management addressed an overbroad covenant not to compete Id at 64 Here there is no finding that the covenant is too broadSecond the language in Data Management that Cash emphasizes the distinction between whether the covenant seeks to eliminate competition which would be unfair to the employer or merely seeks to eliminate ordinary competition is just one factor among nine that are listed Id at 65 Other factors such as whether the covenant operates as a bar to the employees sole means of support and the absence or presence of limitations as to time and space indicate that the clause is reasonable Id at 65 This conclusion is reenforced by our reference to UCC  2302 which indicates that the clause must be unconscionable in order to alter the covenant Data Management 757 P2d at 65Even assuming that Cash is correct on the procedures for obtaining Corps contracts other courts have refused to place the publics interest in competitive bidding on public projects ahead of a partners obligation not to compete See Leff v Gunter 33 Cal3d 508 189 CalRptr 377 384 658 P2d 740 747 1983 en banc partner still violating continuing duty not to compete with partnership even though partner withdrew Moreover Judge Katz found that there is no evidence that enforcement of the covenant not to compete against Cash is likely to cause significant harm to public interestiv Damages awarded under the noncompete clauseFinally Cash argues that the superior court incorrectly measured Wirums damages for Cashs breach of the noncompete clause by Cashs expected profits Cash claims that Wirum had to prove some actual damages Wirum responds that the trial court did not award damages based on Cashs profit Rather it considered Cashs profit as evidence of Wirums loss Wirum further contends that if the court awarded Wirum Cashs profit it is legally supportableCash offers no authority for his argument Wirum by contrast convincingly argues that a court can consider the profit of the breaching party In National Bank of Alaska v JBL  K of Alaska Inc 546 P2d 579 590 Alaska 1976 we held the measure for breach of a covenant not to compete is generally not the profits earned by the breaching party asserting the breach We cited to Merager v Turnbull 2 Wash2d 711 99 P2d 434 439 1940 which held that the defendants profit may be considered in evidence if shown to correspond in whole or in part to plaintiffs loss for impairment of good will Other courts have found that the breaching partys profits can be a reasonable basis for estimating plaintiffs damages See North Pac Lumber Co v Moore 275 Or 359 551 P2d 431 43536 1976 Dunn v Ward 105 Idaho 354 356 670 P2d 59 61 Idaho App1983VI WHETHER MARY LOU WIRUM IS JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ASSESSED AGAINST WIRUMThe superior court found thatMary Lou Wirum owed a fiduciary duty to the partnership of Wirum  Cash and to Larry Cash because she was entrusted to manage money belonging to the partnership and to keep accurate records for the benefit of both partners and not for the primary benefit of C Harold Wirum her husband and herself Mary Lou Wirum breached her fiduciary duties owed to Larry CashWirum argues that inadequate findings of fact exist to show that Mary Lou Wirum had agreed to act on Cashs behalf Wirum alternatively argues that assessing liability for damages assessed against himself and against Mary Lou Wirum as well was error because only Wirum was party to the partnership and buyin agreementMary Lou Wirum should be held jointly and severally liable The superior court held that the evidence in this case proved that Mary Lou Wirum had substantial interwoven interests with C Harold Wirum in the acts and transactions involved in this litigation This factual finding is not clearly erroneous The court lists a few twentysix of the facts which support its conclusion The superior court found that while Wirum was managing partner in actual practice at all times during its existence Wirum delegated this responsibility to Mary Lou Wirum who undertook the responsibility for and supervised the business and accounting functions of the partnership Mary Lou Wirum herself saidFor the past 30 years I have been intimately involved in the organizational and financial matters of Wirum  Cash Architects and of C Harold Wirum as a sole practitioner as well as CCWC Architects and Maynard  Wirum Architects partnerships of which C Harold Wirum was a member My involvement with each entity was for the entire period of that entitys existenceApart from the factual intertwining of actions several legal theories support the joint and several award First Mary Lou Wirum assisted Wirum in committing a tort here breach of fiduciary duty she is therefore liable as a joint tortfeasorAn agent who assists another agent or the principal to commit a tort is normally himself liable as a joint tort feasor for the entire damage Thus those who assist in the wrongful removal of chattels  all are subject to liability together with those for whom they act except where their good faith creates a privilege in them to actRestatement Second Agency  343 comment d 1958The superior courts ability to join the parties is clear1 Principal and agent can be joined in an action for a wrong resulting from the tortious conduct of an agent or that of agent and principal and a judgment can be rendered against eachRestatement Second Agency  217B 1958However the Restatement of Torts reaches a slightly different conclusionA person who knowingly assists a fiduciary in committing a breach of trust is himself guilty of tortious conduct and is subject to liability for the harm thereby caused  The measure of his liability however may be different from that of the fiduciary since he is responsible only for harm caused or profits that he himself has made from the transaction and he is not necessarily liable for the profits that the fiduciary has made nor for those that he should have madeRestatement Second Torts  874 comment c 1979 However given the intertwining of Mary Lou Wirum and Wirums actions as well as their status as partners in other business entities and as husband and wife Wirums gains are indistinguishable from Mary Lou Wirums gainGiven these theories we find it is unnecessary to resolve whether Mary Lou Wirum was an agent of Cash as well as the partnership since we may affirm a trial courts ruling on different grounds than those adopted by the trial courtVII MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS OF ERRORiThe buyin agreementWirum argues that the superior court erred in refunding Cash 47481 that he paid under the buyin agreement and simultaneously crediting Cash with the benefits of 25 ownership when he withdrew eg 44681 which was 25 of the accounts receivable as of March 31 1986 More particularly Wirum contends that the buyin agreement and the partnership agreement were one contract that the evidence did not support that Wirum knowingly misrepresented past income or that Cashs reliance was reasonable and that the court improperly shifted the burden of proofWirum asserts that the trial court treated the buyin agreement and the partnership agreement as two separate contracts allowing rescission as to the buyin agreement and a damage remedy as to the partnership agreement He contends that a damage remedy should have been applied to both Wirum argues that he is entitled to have the buyin agreement enforced and to receive from Cash the remainder of the 250000 or to have the unpaid buyin sums subtracted from the damage award Cash does not deny that the two agreements should be read together as one contract Yet he contends that the court was awarding restitution for his buyin contributions in its damage award Cash argues that he suffered this loss and that Wirum derived this gain from his breach of fiduciary dutiesContrary to what Wirum and Cash argue it seems that the superior court employed a reliance measure of damages However as the measure of damages is not specified upon remand the superior court shall clarify the precise damage theory it is applyingiiCosts and attorneys feesGiven our conclusion that a remand for certain aspects of this case is necessary we find it unnecessary to address Wirums attack on the superior courts award to Cash of attorneys fees and costs Depending on the superior courts resolution of the issues remanded it could conceivably make adjustments to its previous award of attorneys fees and costsiiiNew trial and additional errorsIn footnote 112 of his brief Wirum claims this case should be remanded for a new trial given the overall number of errors In that footnote Wirum lists six alleged errors in addition to those discussed throughout this opinion Given the cursory nature of their presentation we decline to address them Where a point is not given more than a cursory statement in the argument portion of a brief the point will not be considered on appeal State v ONeill Investigations Inc 609 P2d 520 528 Alaska 1980 Fairview Development Inc v City of Fairbanks 475 P2d 35 36 Alaska 1970 cert denied 402 US 901 91 SCt 1374 28 LEd2d 642 1971 Furthermore we are not persuaded that a new trial as opposed to the limited remand called for above is appropriateAFFIRMED in part REVERSED in part and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinionBURKE and MATTHEWS JJ not participating At the partnerships inception Cashs capital contribution was 16000 and Wirums was 48OOO not including the depreciated cost tax basis of Wirums furniture equipment and books worth 83671 Paragraph 16 of the agreement read in part If any partner withdraws or is expelled from the partnership he shall not perform services for a client of the partnership past or present or a client of Wirums architectural practice as a sole practitioner for a two year period thereafter without the consent of the other partners Cash claims that as this finding was not challenged in Wirums opening brief it is waived That Wirums accountant and legal fees were paid is supported by the record The total appears to be approximately 20000 W  C did not pay the equivalent fees for Cash in the formation of the partnership These diversions of partnership resources are supported by the record Wirum contends that these costs were cleared monthly by offsets through dueto and duefrom accountsWirum contends he understood overhead to mean only labor burden or FICA FUTA and workers compensation and not rental costs or office expenses This belies the clear meaning of the term Blacks Law Dictionary 995 5th ed 1979 defines overhead as aIl administrative or executive costs incident to the management supervision or conduct of the capital outlay or business It goes on to say that overhead includes office expensesWirum also contends that he told Cash that the bookkeepers would work for Wirums personal projects in exchange for Mary Lou Wirums supervisory services This is not supported by the agreement the record indicates Mary Lou Wirum received free office space for her services not free bookkeeping services The record supports that monies not needed immediately were transferred to the Wirums personal account Interest earned was not credited to W  C This finding is not challenged Rather Wirum contends this money was due to him as a result of HWA receivables flowing through W  C therefore he practiced good money management Wirum cites John Rothenbueler to support his position yet Rothenbuelers testimony acknowledges its a very complex question and nowhere states that the money transfers reflected perfectly the money transferred to the Merrill Lynch account He even admitted you cant tell  in hindsight Wirum also contends the amounts transferred reduced the interest W  C owed to Wirum for monies he loaned to the firm Yet Marianne Burke an expert accountant showed these transfers resulted in a loss of 9918516 in potential interest to W  C in 1984 through 1986 While Wirum criticizes her analysis his attacks go to the damage amount rather than the existence of a breach Moreover Wirum fails to demonstrate how Burkes conclusion would differ if she considered the factors Wirum indicated she did not consider In 1984 alone if that money had been kept in the partnership 135946 could have been interest earned on excess cash This is supported by the record Wirum argues that this bookkeeping error when dealing with millions of dollars and hundreds of transactions is not a breach of fiduciary duty There is no evidence however to show that it is a mere bookkeeping error ML Wirum Inc was the construction manager for the apartment complexes built by a Wirum entity That company charged HWA 75000 for the services in 1983 yet Mary Lou Wirum caused W  C to pay this expense HWA was never charged interest on this payment Even John Rothenbueler Wirums expert could not say that this money was repaid Expenses for 1983 were posted in December 1983 but not sent out until January 1984 In that year income received by W  C was not reported as being received in 1983 but rather as received in January 1984 This overstated expenses and understated income for W  C for 1983 In 1984 the same thing occurred Expenses were recorded although checks were not mailed until 1985 Income was under reported recording it instead in 1985 The distortion of W  Cs income negatively affected the amount credited to Cash under the buyin and created unnecessary excess capital contributions and interest charges for WirumWirum contends that the year end activity affected the cash income reported to IRS not the firms accrual income and therefore benefited both W  C and Cash He contends it did not effect Cashs buyin obligation However there is no record support given by Wirum The court found that these billing practices were continued through mid year 1984 No interest was paid on these loans The record supports that W  C employees working on the apartment projects were paid by W  C Also W  C records understate the direct labor costs incurred by the partnership for work on the apartment projects Evidence supports the courts conclusion that Wirum did not reimburse W  C for any overhead costs attributable to work performed by W  C employees In 1984 that amount is estimated at 129918Similarly third party consultant costs between 181436 and 193000 were paid by W  C To pay this back Wirum made due from entries on the accounts these did not accrue interest for W  C These interest free loans were taken throughout 1983 1984 and 1985Finally the record supports that the Wirums also owed W  C for expenses related to personal projects in the amount of 64121 in 1983 and 41862 in 1984 This is supported by the record An exhibit submitted by Cash showed Wirum dedicated 21 of his time to personal projects versus 37 to W  C projects in 1983 31 to personal projects and 23 to W  C projects in 1984 1 to personal projects and 21 to W  C projects in 1985 and none to personal projects and 28 to W  C projects in the first quarter of 1986 Again Cash emphasizes that as Wirum did not challenge this finding in his opening brief his arguments are waivedHowever in his crossappellee brief Wirum claims W  C received credit for all time spent on these projects Yet Rothenbuelers testimony only indicated that he computed W  C employees contributions not the partners time spent on personal projects While Cash might have known of these projects when he entered the partnership it is unclear if Cash knew of the magnitude of time involved or if his knowledge was relevant given that the partnership agreement stated Each partner shall devote substantially all of his full time attention and best efforts to the interests and affairs of the partnershipWhile Wirum says this time included time off for personal emergencies which Cash authorized he does not detail the quantity of time this entailedWhile W  C reported a loss of 212019 in 1983 W  C reported profits of 252305 in 1984 431091 in 1985 and 96018 in the first three months of 1986 W  C had no need to carry loans or receive excess capital contributions after February 1984 In fact under Burkes analysis W  C should have had excess cash which would have earned 85572 by the end of 1985 Yet interest due to the Wirums for loans and excess capital contributions totalled 229064 for the partnership years and less than half was attributable to 1983 and 1984 the time for which the firm may have needed excess capital contributionsIn March 1986 a check was drawn for interest owed to Wirum for loans to W  C from 1983 to 1985 in the amount of 21029529 The loans were unnecessary Rather the true interest that was due was 5466 for the original excess capital contribution plus 11228 for working capital loans in 1983 The interest should have been 816 for working capital loans in 1984 There should have been no interest due for 1985 or 1986Janet Niemann a CPA and firm bookkeeper prepared computations on interest due Wirum for providing operating capital to the firm for 198385 She determined that 210295 was due Wirum and a check for this amount was paid to Wirum The calculations of interest during this period were based on contributions passing through the accounts of W  C rather than on what was reasonably necessary to meet the operating capital needs of W  C Touche Ross did an accounting for the firm and determined the correct amount should have been 94369 Wirum agrees an error was made and it should be corrected There is no explicit requirement in Alaskas Uniform Partnership Act that any books be kept although it is arguably implicit in AS 3205140 location and access to partnership books and AS 3205150 duty of partners to provide information However once Wirum chose to keep books they needed to be adequate Bromberg and Ribstein on Partnership  605b at 653 Otherwise the partnership may be deemed to have breached the duty to disclose Rogers v Stacy 63 NM 317 318 P2d 1116 1957 Jackson v Jackson 343 IllApp 31 98 NE2d 169 1951 Clear financial records delineate the parties individual interests and deter selfdealing and mismanagement by providing a monitoring mechanism See Bromberg and Ribstein on Partnership  605a at 6523 See also Frankel Fiduciary Law 71 CalLRev 795 826 1983 Wirum claims that he acted in good faith However a finding of the absence of good faith is implicit in a finding that a fiduciary breach occurred Froemming v Gate City Federal Sav and Loan Assn 822 F2d 723 731 8th Cir1987 In Froemming the court saidGood faith in turn depends upon the knowledge understanding and intent of the partner who is charged with breach of fiduciary duty as well as the understanding knowledge and intent of his copartners It also depends upon the circumstances of whatever action is alleged to be a breach of duty Necessarily the determination of whether an action is undertaken in good faith requires the factfinder to weigh the credibility of the witnesses gauge nuances of voice and expression and sift through competing and conflicting versions of what occurred and what state of mind each actor brought to the occurrenceIdAs to the specifics the superior court found that the prepayment of expenses did not benefit W  C but created a need for the partnership to borrow from the Wirums Wirum claims that this was clearly erroneous The Wirums claim the partnership would have had to borrow from a bank and no evidence existed that W  C had the funds to pay the first two months rent and parking from partnership income Cash does not specifically respond to this argument However the superior court appears to have considered Wirums contention in finding a breach It acknowledged that W  C needed additional working capital during the first few months of its existence but not after 1984The superior court found that the yearend tax reporting system diminished Cashs ability to pay off his buyin obligation Wirum claims that it reduced the principal that Cash had to pay Mr Wirum on his buyin Cash seems to accept this argument and calls it false comfort He claims rather that he may not have withdrawn had the profits been fairly represented It is clear in any event that the practice created unnecessary working capital loans and interest charges and it caused Cash to owe 45000 more on his capital accounts and an additional 48000 on the buyin The finding that Wirum had a personal interest in manipulating W  Cs income was not clearly erroneousAs to the capital account Wirum argues that Cash never paid his negative balance and that tax deferral procedures catch up eventually Cash responds that he never received the benefits of the partnership and the superior court charged him for his share of the partnerships capital accounts in its damage award While Cash undoubtedly received some benefit from the partnership the superior court did award Wirum 39850 which was Cashs negative balance of his capital account as of March 31 1986 The interest owed by W  C to Wirum based on the amount passing through in 1983 amounted to 5272973 A bookkeeper later computed the correct amount to be 44037 Another bookkeeper however used the 5272973 figure to compute interest for 1984 1985 and part of 1986 From 1983 until March 1986 22906452 was calculated as interest accruing on loans made to W  C by Wirum Wirum now admits an error was made and should be corrected However Burke admitted she did not perform an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards on the W  C financial statements However Mary Lou Wirum claims she herself undertook to determine what loans were reasonably necessary for W  C to meet its operating capital needs Testimony of Susan Monsen an accountant who worked at W  C supports that these deposits were made Testimony from Margaret Ward a bookkeeper at W  C supports that the interest earned was not returned to W  C Arguably sufficient evidence exists to support a finding of misrepresentation Most significantly Cash testified that he believed HWA was making an average of 500000 per year for the last five years based on rjepresentations that had been made to me during the partnership negotiations  both verbally and in written documentation The verbal representations were made by Wirum and Mary Lou Wirum in 1982 While Wirum contends that this selfserving testimony as to Cashs subjective belief is not probative Cashs testimony is corroborated A letter to a loan officer signed by Wirum and Cash and typed by Mary Lou Wirum stated Wirums last five years earning as a sole practitioner have averaged 500000year Wirums experience at startup of his sole practice was a negative cash basis profit in Year 1 a positive to approximately equal the Year 1 negative cash basis profit in Year 2 Emphasis added Also a letter from Wirum to a potential partner stated Prior to forming the partnership my earnings had been in the 500000 annual range It should be stressed that for the future partnership to continue to generate these type earnings sic will take an overallteammanagement effort  in which case the monetary benefits are there Although these letters were written on March 19 1985 and October 25 1984 respectively after the partnership was formed they corroborate Cashs allegations of misrepresentation Also attorney Thomas McLaughlin wrote in December 17 1982 that the assumption was earnings from the new partnership would be 500000 per year which could be applied to Cashs buyin obligation This assumption was based on a letter addressed to McLaughlin and Touche Ross  Co from Mary Lou Wirum on December 15 1982 Mary Lou Wirums letter does contain some ambiguity because it does not affirmatively state that the 500000 figure is only from Wirums architectural practiceInstead in the agreement Larry and Harold will agree that for purposes of computing the retirement death or disability pay Wirums agreed five consecutive full highest years will be a minimum of 500000year The retirement death or disability pay payment formula to Wirum will be based upon this figure unless Wirum has higher earnings following the formation of the partnership Paragraph 27 readsPayments to Withdrawn or Expelled Partner A former partner who has withdrawn or been expelled from the partnership shall be entitled to receive the following amounts and no others provided the former partner has complied with all the provisions of this agreement i The credit balance of his capital account ii The credit balance of his drawing accountThe books and records of the partnership shall be closed at the end of the month in which the withdrawal or expulsion occurs A computation of capital and drawing accounts shall then be made in the same manner as at the end of each quarter and so will reflect as operating expenses all items of accrued expenses and prepaid expenses Accrued expense shall include a reasonable provision for a proportionate share of normal fiscal year end expenses No other amounts or benefits shall be payable to a withdrawn or expelled partner including any amount for accounts receivable or work in process Such measures are agreed upon to compensate the partnership for its costs and losses arising from the withdrawing or expulsion of the former partnerEmphasis added Compare with Obert v Environmental Research  Devel Corp 112 Wash2d 323 771 P2d 340 341 1989 Barrett v Byrnes 556 P2d 1254 1255 Alaska 1976 no implied consent exists when an issue is raised for the first time after plaintiff has rested his caseCash additionally argues that the superior courts findings relating to Wirums breach of contract and fiduciary duties constituted a finding of unclean hands and thus are complete defenses to Wirums claims on the noncompetition clause The doctrine of unclean hands is an equitable remedy Here we conclude that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in failing to apply the doctrine Cash also emphasizes that Judge Katz reasonably interpreted the clause Yet there is no showing that the clause here is unreasonable given the factors to be considered Data Management 757 P2d at 65 A predicate to the court altering an overbroad covenant not to compete to render it enforceable based on what restrictions would be reasonable between the parties is that the overbroad covenant was drafted in good faith Data Management 757 P2d at 64 There are two different Corps projects mentioned in the appeal One was a project done for 400000 during the noncompete period The court found a violation of the noncompete clause and awarded Wirum 50000 This is the subject of Cashs crossappeal infra The Corps project under discussion here was a project at Fort Wainwright solicited during the noncompete period The superior court made no finding as to whether or not this violated the noncompete clause Cash also states that no findings concerning violation of the noncompetition clause were necessary given this language and because no contract was formed during the relevant period The superior court did find that the preliminary injunction was well founded in law adopting the original courts reasoning The superior court foundCash violated the noncompetition clause by contracting with the Corps of Engineers to perform architectural services within two 2 years of March 31 1986 Wirum submitted a bid with the Corps of Engineers and Cash competed with WirumCash claims Wirum never submitted a bid with the Corps of Engineers on this projectCashs argument lacks merit First as Wirum argues the evidence conflicted on this point The trial courts resolution of this dispute is not clearly erroneous Preferred General Agency of Alaska Inc v Raffetto 391 P2d 951 95253 Alaska 1964 Second and not argued by Wirum the noncompete clause restrains Cash from doing business with a client of W  C regardless of whether Wirum chose to bid on the project In fact in its conclusions of law the superior court said Cash violated the noncompetition clause by contracting and performing work for a client for whom HWA andor W  C had done work the US Corps of Engineers Wirum is entitled to recover the profit of 50000 Cash made on this contract Cash argues that the facts adduced at trial indicate that the injunction should not have been issued Cash claims he should have received damages for being wrongfully enjoinedIn the event the superior court determines on remand that Wirums breaches excused Cash from compliance with the noncompete clause the superior court should redetermine this issue Mary Lou Wirum was head bookkeeper Her accounting caused Cashs withdrawal The superior court found Cash relied upon the information provided to him by the Wirums and concluded that it would be a financial hardship if not impossible to make the payments demanded by the Wirums under the partnership agreement Harold Wirum is liable for Mary Lou Wirums errorsA person conducting an activity through servants or other agents is subject to
