['OPINION\nFABE, Justice.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis appeal involves a fire that destroyed the Fancyboy family home in Pilot Station. One of the Fancyboy children was killed in the fire and two other family members were injured. The Fancyboys sued Alaska Village Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AVEC) for negligence. Although a jury found AVEC partially liable, allocating forty percent of fault to AVEC and sixty percent of fault to the father, Raymond Fancyboy, it only awarded the Fancyboys pi\'operty damages. The trial court found that the jury\'s failure to award at least stipulated medical expenses was inconsistent with its finding that AVEC was partially liable. After the jury deliberated further, it rendered a second verdict that included the stipulated medical expenses.\nThe Fancyboys appeal, claiming that AS 09.17.080 does not permit the trial court to reduce the verdict by the percentage of fault allocated to Raymond. They further argue that the second jury verdict was inconsistent in its failure to make any award for non-economic damages. AVEC cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to reinstate the original verdict. Because we conclude that both the original and amended jury verdicts were inconsistent, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\nII. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nRaymond and Kathy Fancyboy and their children moved to Pilot Station in the spring of 1992. Soon after their arrival, they bought a small home next to Kathy\'s mother\'s house. When the family moved into the house, it did not have electrical service because AVEC, which provides electricity to Pilot Station, had not connected the Fancy-boy home to its distribution system.\nRaymond claims that in early 1992 he contacted the local AVEC representative, Tom Heckman, about obtaining service for his new home. Heckman allegedly told Raymond that no one from AVEC could come to Pilot Station to install an overhead line for several months. Raymond maintains that Heckman recommended that the Fancyboys run a jump line from another meter box to their house and that Raymond contact Wayne Francis, a former AVEC employee, for assistance with this project. Heckman denies having this conversation.\nKathy\'s mother agreed to let the Fancy-boys run a jump line from her meter box to their house until AVEC could install an overhead power line. Raymond then spliced two pieces of wire together and ran the line from his mother-in-law\'s house to his home, a distance of approximately seventy-five feet. In doing so, Raymond used white Romex cable, a common interior house wire that can handle only limited voltage.\nWayne Francis, who had installed jump lines before, helped Raymond by connecting the wires from the meter box at Raymond\'s mother-in-law\'s house to the Fancyboy home. Francis warned Raymond not to run too many appliances off the Romex wire. Francis also connected each end of the cable to a circuit breaker and told Raymond that the breaker would trip if the wire were overloaded. Heckman, the AVEC representative, admitted knowing that a jump line ran from Kathy\'s mother\'s house to the Fancy-boy home and that the type of wire used was potentially dangerous.\nAfter Francis completed the connection, the Fancyboy home appeared to receive enough electricity. At first, the Fancyboys needed electricity only for basic lighting, a stereo, and a television. Later in the summer, the Fancyboys bought a small refrigerator, a washing machine, and a freezer. When they used several appliances at once, the circuit breaker would occasionally trip, and Raymond would reset the breaker at his mother-in-law\'s house.\nPregnant with the Fancyboys\' fourth child, Kathy left Pilot Station in early August to stay at the Bethel Prematernal Home. During her absence, Raymond cared for the other three children: Janan, age five; Willie, age three; and Todd, age two. On September 24,
    1992, Raymond took Janan to school. On the way home with his two sons, Raymond stopped at his brother-in-law\'s house, where he drank "about six, eight-ounce cups" of beer. After Raymond and the boys returned home, all three settled on the couch to watch cartoons. Raymond fell asleep and awoke to smoke, pounding on the wall, and the boys\' cries. Raymond located Todd and passed him out of a window to one of the villagers. Because of the smoke and heat, he could not find Willie and had to leave the house through a window. As Willie cried from inside the house, Raymond tried to reenter the house, but his neighbors held him back. The house burned to the ground in less than forty-five minutes.\nWillie died in the fire. Todd experienced third-degree burns on his scalp, forehead, chin, neck, hands, and lower back. Raymond suffered pneumonia from smoke inhalation and burns on his right hand and lower back.\nBecause the Fancyboys\' house burned to the ground, little physical evidence existed from which investigators could determine the cause of the fire. The deputy state fire marshal concluded that the most likely cause of the fire was electrical, due to a voltage drop that occurred when the electricity flowed through the undersized cable over a long distance. He also concluded that the fire most likely started on the porch near the freezer. The Fancyboys\' expert witness confirmed the fire marshal\'s conclusions. The expert testified that the freezer likely malfunctioned due to the reduced current delivered through the Romex wire, causing the freezer compressor to overheat and ignite nearby plastics and combustibles.\nThe Fancyboys filed suit against AVEC, alleging, among other things, negligent failure to inspect or discover the dangerous condition and negligent failure to warn the Fancyboys of the condition. AVEC defended by contending that the fire was not electrical in origin and that the children had started it. Alternatively, AVEC argued that Raymond failed to supervise his sons adequately. The jury found that both AVEC and Raymond were negligent and that the negligence of each was a legal cause of injury to the Fancyboys. The jury then allocated forty percent of fault to AVEC and sixty percent of fault to Raymond.\nThe jury awarded $100,
    000 to Raymond and Kathy for damages to their home and personal property. Kathy, as personal representative of Willie\'s estate and legal guardian of Todd, did not receive any recovery. Neither Kathy nor Raymond received any damages for loss of consortium. Raymond received no compensation for his painful injuries.\nThe trial judge and counsel for both parties agreed that the jury\'s failure to award stipulated medical expenses was inconsistent with its finding that AVEC was partially liable. The Fancyboys also argued that the jury\'s failure to award any non-economic damages was inconsistent with its determination that AVEC\'s negligence was a legal cause of the fire.\nThe court attempted to cure the inconsistency with a supplemental jury instruction on the stipulated medical expenses, deferring "for a different day" the issue of whether the evidence supported the jury\'s decision not to award non-economic damages. The court informed the jury of the inconsistency between its finding that AVEC\'s negligence was a legal cause of the plaintiffs\' harm and its decision not to award the stipulated medical damages and asked the jury to redeliberate, allowing it to reconsider any of its findings.\nThe jury returned a second verdict, awarding stipulated medical damages for Raymond and Todd\'s injuries, as well as an amount for Todd\'s future medical expenses. The jury made no other changes to the verdict. A jury poll revealed that the verdict was unanimous.\nAVEC later moved to reinstate the original verdict, arguing that the verdict was consistent after all. AVEC reasoned that the jury could have believed both that AVEC was a legal cause of the property damage and that Raymond was a superseding cause of Willie\'s death and the personal injuries suffered by the family. The trial court agreed with AVEC\'s position that the original verdict was consistent but concluded that AVEC had waived that argument when it agreed to the supplemental jury instruction. Thus, the court denied AVEC\'s motion to reinstate the original verdict.\nThe Fancyboys moved for a new trial on non-economic damages, arguing that they had established these damages by the clear weight of the evidence. Based on its determination that the first verdict was actually consistent, the court denied the Fancyboys\' motion for a new trial.\nWhen the superior court entered final judgment, it reduced the damage awards to each plaintiff by sixty percent, the percentage of fault allocated to Raymond. But it also determined that the Fancyboys were the prevailing party and awarded them attorney\'s fees. The Fancyboys appeal the trial court\'s reduction of the awards and its refusal to grant a new trial on damages. AVEC cross-appeals the trial court\'s refusal to reinstate the original verdict and the court\'s designation of the Fancyboys as the prevailing-party for the purpose of awarding attorney\'s fees.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Reducing the Fancyboys\' Recovery by the Proportion of Fault Allocated to Raymond.\nThe Fancyboys argue that the trial court erred by reducing the jury\'s damage awards to Kathy, Todd, and the estate of Willie by the percentage of fault allocated to Raymond. They assert that AS 09.17.080, the statute governing fault allocation in tort cases, does not permit courts to allocate fault to a co-plaintiff who has not been named as a third-party defendant pursuant to Alaska Civil Rule 14(c). To support their interpretation, the Fancyboys assert that a co-plaintiff is not a "party to the claim" for purposes of AS 09.17.080(a)(2).\nThe question whether AS 09.17.080 permits reduction of one plaintiffs verdict by the percentage of a co-plaintiffs fault is an issue of first impression in Alaska. When we construe the meaning of a statute, we apply our independent judgment. We look to "the meaning of the language, the legislative history, and the purpose of the statute in question." We then adopt the rule of law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.\nAlaska Statute 09.17.080 expressly instructs a court or jury to apportion fault to each party liable on the basis of several liability. In particular, AS 09.17.080(a)(2) requires the trial court to instruct the jury to decide "the percentage of the total fault of all the parties to each claim, that is allocated to each claimant, defendant, third-party defendant, and person who has been released from liability." (Emphasis added.) The Fancy-boys interpret this language to mean that unless the defendant names the negligent co-plaintiff as a third-party defendant, the negligent co-plaintiff is not a party to the non-negligent plaintiffs claim against the defendant, and, thus, a court cannot reduce a non-negligent plaintiffs recovery by the negligent co-plaintiffs fault. Because the members of the Fancyboy family assert distinguishable claims, they maintain that a court cannot reduce any awards to the innocent claimants based on Raymond\'s fault.\nWe assume as a rule of statutory interpretation that the same words used twice in the same statute have the same meaning. In Benner v. Wiclvman, we construed the meaning of the term "party" in the context of AS 09.17.080(d), which requires that the court enter judgment "against each party liable . in accordance with that party\'s percentage of fault." We determined that the use of the term "party" in AS 09.17.080(a) — "party to the action, including third-party defendants and persons who have been released" — should be applied to subsection (d) as well. In doing so, we recognized the importance,
    "[wjhenever possible, [to] construe each part or section of a statute with every other part or section, to produce a harmonious whole." Applying this rule of construction, we conclude that AS 09.17.080(a)(2) allows the jury to allocate fault to Raymond as a party to the action.\nHere, the jury allocated sixty percent of the fault to Raymond and forty percent of the fault to AVEC. According to AS 09.17.080(d), the court could only enter judgment against AVEC for its equitable share of the obligation. Thus, while the other Fan-cyboys may bear no fault, Raymond\'s fault as their co-plaintiff reduces their recovery from AVEC.\nThe Fancyboys also object to AVEC\'s failure to name Raymond as a third-party defendant under Civil Rule 14(c). They first argue that allocating fault to a co-plaintiff who has never been named as a third-party defendant could result in an injustice to the innocent co-plaintiff who may not receive full compensation for losses suffered: "[I]f a defendant contends one plaintiff is negligent but does not name that plaintiff as a third-party defendant, the defendant may reduce its own liability to all the plaintiffs and deny the innocent, non-negligent plaintiffs the opportunity to recover fully for their damages." But here, because of the familial relationship, the Fancyboys have not asserted any interest in collecting from Raymond the remaining sixty percent share of the judgment; the concern that they express is purely hypothetical. Thus, the Fancyboys\' point that an innocent plaintiff may be unable to recover from a liable co-plaintiff who has not been joined as a third-party defendant need not be addressed in this case.\nThe Fancyboys next argue that because AVEC failed to file a third-party claim for allocation of fault as provided by Civil Rule 14(c), they were not properly notified of AVEC\'s plan to allocate fault to Raymond. But as the trial court recognized, AVEC\'s answer to the Fancyboys\' complaint contained the affirmative defense that "[a]ny damages . were caused, in whole or in part, by the negligence of one or more of the plaintiffs." We thus agree with the trial court\'s conclusion that the Fancyboys had adequate notice that AVEC planned to make a claim for apportionment.\nBecause AS 09.17.080 allows allocation of fault to a co-plaintiff as a party to the action without requiring the defendant to implead the co-plaintiff as a third-party defendant and because AVEC provided adequate notice of its intent to allocate fault to Raymond, we conclude that the trial court did not err in reducing the Fancyboys\' recovery by Raymond\'s allocation of fault.\nB. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Denying the Motion to Reinstate the Original Verdict.\nAVEC contends in its cross-appeal that the trial court should have granted its motion to reinstate the original verdict on the ground that it was consistent. In its first verdict, the jury found that AVEC\'s negligence was a legal cause of the fire but only awarded the Fancyboys damages for destruction of their home and other family property. This verdict puzzled the court and counsel for both parties because the parties had stipulated to certain medical costs as damages. The superior court provided clarifying instructions to the jury on this matter, directing it to redeli-berate and allowing it to reconsider "any finding which you have made."\nAfter the superior court entered final judgment based on an amended verdict that included the stipulated medical expenses, AVEC attempted to justify the first verdict\'s perceived inconsistencies by arguing that the jury could have concluded that AVEC was a legal cause of property damage to the house but that Raymond\'s conduct was a superseding cause of all personal injuries suffered by the Fancyboys. The superior court agreed that this theory reconciled any perceived inconsistencies in the original verdict:\nI realized how this verdict could be consistent and it\'s in fact how defendants have argued it.... [Ajlthough Mr. Fancyboy was not a superseding cause as to the fire,
        [it could be
        ] that he was a superseding cause as to the physical harm to the parties or that the jury could have rationally viewed it as such.\nYet the judge found that AVEC had waived reinstitution of the first verdict by agreeing at trial to resubmit the issue to the jury.\nWe need not address the waiver issue here because we conclude that the original verdict was inconsistent as a matter of law. AVEC\'s proposed justification for the first verdict assumes that a jury could properly find that Raymond\'s conduct was a superseding cause of liability for non-economic damages. AVEC contends that if Raymond had not been drinking, he would have supervised the children properly and possibly prevented the fire. Under our case law on superseding cause, however, any negligence in Raymond\'s supervision does not release AVEC from its liability for the resulting damages.\nAn event can have a superseding cause when "after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor\'s negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm." But "[a]n intervening cause that lies within the scope of the foreseeable risk, or has a reasonable connection to it, is not a superseding cause." Thus, a third party\'s conduct is not a superseding cause as a matter of law if the conduct was within the scope of foreseeable risk created by the defendant\'s negligence.\nFor example, in Osborne v. Russell, Osborne was fatally electrocuted when he reached into a floor safe and brushed bare wires sticking out of an open electrical box at the store where he worked. The representative of Osborne\'s estate sued the store\'s electrician for negligence. We held that "the fact that someone flipped over the circuit breaker and pulled out the wires does not, as a matter of law, amount to a superseding cause." Similarly, in Gordon v. Alaska Pacific Bancorporation, the plaintiff was attacked and injured after intervening in a fight at a company party. The plaintiff sued the host company for negligent performance of its duty to provide security for his safety. We concluded as a matter of law that neither the plaintiffs intervention in the fight nor the subsequent attack on the plaintiff by one of the participants in the fight was a superseding cause of the plaintiffs injuries. Finally, in Loeb v. Rasmussen., a minor committed suicide following an alcohol-related car accident. The representative of the minor\'s estate sued the owner of the store that had sold liquor to the minor prior to the accident. We held that the minor\'s willful misconduct in unlawfully buying and consuming alcohol and then driving while intoxicated was not a superseding cause of her injuries because "[i]t is well within the scope of foreseeable risk that a minor who purchases alcohol may drive an automobile, and that an alcohol-related accident may result."\nAt trial in this case, AVEC argued in both its opening statement and closing argument that the fire was not electrical in origin; rather, AVEC maintained that the children had started the fire due to Raymond\'s failure to supervise. But the jury\'s determination that AVEC\'s negligence was a legal cause of the fire indicates that it found that the fire was electrical in origin. Raymond\'s conduct in falling asleep while the children were home and failing to awaken during an electrical fire, even if due to drinking, was entirely within the scope of foreseeable risk from AVEC\'s negligence. Thus, even if Raymond\'s negligence was an intervening, contributory cause, it was not a superseding cause. In turn, AVEC should have been held liable for.its proportionate share of all resulting damages.\nAccordingly, the jury\'s first verdict, which failed to make any award for the Fancyboys\' medical expenses or their non-economic damages was necessarily inconsistent. Thus, we affirm the trial court\'s denial of AVEC\'s motion to reinstate the original verdict.\nC. The Trial Court Erred by Denying the Fancyboys\' Motion for a Neiv Tnal.\nAfter the court instructed the jury to rede-liberate, the jury continued to award only property damages and the stipulated medical expenses even though AVEC never disputed the Fancyboys\' showing of non-economic harm. Upon return of this verdict, the trial court commented that the verdict was "not particularly a logical verdict." But based on its retrospective conclusion that the first verdict was consistent, the trial court refused to grant a new trial. The Fancyboys argue that the trial court should have granted a new trial because the second verdict was inconsistent in its exclusion of non-economic damages.\nAVEC first contends that the Fan-cyboys waived their right to challenge the consistency of the second verdict because the Fancyboys did not make an additional objection to inconsistency upon return of the second verdict. To preserve an inconsistency objection, the party must have asked for resubmission of the issue prior to the discharge of the jury.\nAs the Fancyboys point out, they made two separate objections after the first verdict: They objected to both the jury\'s failure to include the stipulated medical expenses and its failure to include any non-economic damages. The court instructed the jury that it must consider stipulated medical damages but declined to address the issue of the jury\'s failure to award non-economic damages: "I think there are two problems. One of which is a problem for a different day." This remark suggests that the court viewed the jury\'s failure to award non-economic damages as a problem with the adequacy of the verdict, rather than an inconsistency that required an immediate cure. By phrasing the issues in this way, the court effectively represented to the Fancyboys that they had preserved their objection to the failure to award non-economic damages. Because the Fancyboys could have reasonably relied on that representation, we conclude that they did not need to make the same objection to inconsistency after the second verdict.\nWe now turn to the consistency of the second verdict. As we discussed with respect to the first verdict, in light of the jury\'s determination that the fire was electrical in origin, Raymond\'s failure to wake up during the fire to supervise the children was a foreseeable result of AVEC\'s negligence. Thus, although Raymond\'s negligence may have been an intervening cause of the Fancy-boys\' injuries, it could not have been a superseding cause. Accordingly, AVEC is liable for its proportionate share of all resulting damages, whether economic or non-economic. We see no principled way for the jury to have awarded damages for property loss and medical expenses but not non-economic damages to compensate the Fancyboys for their painful burns and their loss of consortium due to Willie\'s\' death. Because the second verdict was inconsistent, a new trial is indeed "required in the interest of justice" pursuant to Alaska Civil Rule 59(a).\nThe Fancyboys also ask us to direct the trial court on remand to limit the new trial to the issue of damages. At the end of the trial, the trial court suggested that any new trial would require resubmission of all issues to the jury. The question of "[w]hat issues are to be relitigated upon remand, in the absence of a directive from this court, is within the discretion of the trial court.""Whether the issues [of liability and damages] are sufficiently separable to warrant a partial new trial depends on the facts and circumstances of each case." In comparative negligence cases, we have upheld trial court decisions granting a partial new trial on the issue of liability alone, the issue of damages alone, and a full trial on both the liability and damages issues. Given the broad discretion that we afford trial courts on this matter, we leave it to the superior court to determine whether a new trial on all issues will be necessary.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the first and second verdicts in this case were inconsistent as a mat ter of law. Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND for a new trial.\nCARPENETI, Justice, not participating.\n. In 1991 AVEC had converted its system at Pilot Station from covered utilidors to overhead lines. Because the Fancyboys\' house was empty at the time of the conversion, AVEC did not install an overhead line.\n. Individuals often use jump lines in bush Alaska to provide power to steambaths and other outbuildings. If the jump line is attached properly, the meter box registers the electricity being used, so AVEC can bill the customer for the extra use.\n.The version of AS 09.17.080 that governs this case took effect in 1989. It provides:\n(a) In all actions involving fault of more than one party to the action, including third-party defendants and persons who have been released under AS 09.16.040, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings, indicating\n(1) the amount of damages each claimant would be entitled to recover if contributory fault is disregarded; and\n(2) the percentage of the total fault of all of the parties to each claim that is allocated to each claimant, defendant, third-party defendant, and person who has been released from liability under AS 09.16.040.\n(b) In determining the percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault, and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed. The trier of fact may determine that two or more persons are to be treated as a single party if their conduct was a cause of the damages claimed and the separate act or omission of each person cannot be distinguished.\n(c) The courl shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings, subject to a reduction under AS 09.16.040, and enter judgment against each party liable. The court also shall determine and state in the judgment each party\'s equitable share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the respective percentages of fault.\n(d)The court shall enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of several liability in accordance with that party\'s percentage of fault.\nThe statute changed following trial in this case. See ch. 26,
        11-13 SLA 1997 (effective Aug. 7,
        1997).\n. Civil Rule 14(c) provides:\nFor purposes of apportioning damages under AS 09.17.080, a defendant, as a third-party plaintiff, may follow the procedure of paragraph (a) to add as a third-party defendant any person whose fault may have been a cause of the damages claimed by the plaintiff. Judgment may be entered against a third-party defendant in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the third-party defendant\'s respective percentage of fault, regardless of whether the plaintiff has asserted a direct claim against tire third-party defendant.\n.

INTRODUCTION\nRay Woodrow McCubbins and his wife, Rona McCubbins, appeal from a jury verdict awarding McCubbins $26,
        914.10 against the State of Alaska for injuries sustained in a diving accident at Big Lake. They appeal the trial court\'s failure to grant them a new trial on the issue of damages; its determination that the State was the prevailing party for purposes of Civil Rule 82 attorney\'s fees; and its award of decreased prejudgment interest pursuant to Civil Rule 68. We hold that the jury\'s damage award was inconsistent and order a new trial on the issue of damages.\nII. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nA. Facts\nOn May 31,
        1993, Ray "Woody" McCub-bins, his wife, Rona, and several friends went jet skiing at the Big Lake North Recreation Site (Big Lake site) near Wasilla. The Big Lake site is owned by the State of Alaska and managed by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. A floating orange boomline separates a swimming area from boat traffic on the rest of the lake. During a break from jet skiing, McCubbins ran into the lake at the swimming area and performed a belly-flop. At this point in the lake, the water was approximately two to three feet deep. McCubbins struck his head on what was likely a large submerged rock.\nMcCubbins\'s friends drove him to the AIC Medical Clinic in Wasilla where he was treated by Ed Manning, a physician\'s assistant. Manning stitched together McCubbins\'s head laceration and took X-rays of McCubbins\'s neck, which indicated a "teardrop fracture." Manning referred McCubbins to Valley Hospital in Palmer. That same day, Valley Hospital reviewed McCubbins\'s X-rays, ordered a CT scan and notified McCubbins\'s Anchorage family physician, Dr. Robert Hall.\nMcCubbins returned to his job as a truck driver with Weaver Brothers in Anchorage. Three days later McCubbins saw Dr. Hall, who sent him to the Providence Hospital Emergency Room for new X-rays of his neck. Approximately two weeks later, McCubbins referred himself to Dr. Lynn Taylor, a neurologist at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. Dr. Taylor concluded that McCubbins had a small compression fracture in a neck bone, but was not a surgical candidate. On Dr. Taylor\'s advice, McCubbins sought physical therapy at Chu-gach Physical Therapy in Anchorage. McCubbins testified that the physical therapy increased his pain due to exercises designed to eventually expand the range of motion in his neck.\nDr. Hall reexamined McCubbins in August and released him for work. McCubbins resumed truck driving that month. However, McCubbins began to experience a numbing and tingling sensation in his limbs. He returned to Dr. Hall, who conducted another MRI at Providence Hospital. McCubbins then sought treatment from Dr. Lee Dorey in Tacoma in September 1993. Dr. Dorey recommended that McCubbins undergo a two-level anterior cervical fusion to fuse his fractured neck vertebrae. McCubbins did not obtain a second opinion. McCubbins underwent the fusion surgery and returned to Anchorage in October 1993 for physical therapy but did not return to work. The surgery alleviated the numbness and tingling, but McCubbins\'s neck pain increased. In November McCubbins returned to Weaver Brothers as a full-time office employee. In the spring of 1994, McCubbins again saw Dr. Dorey because he began suffering from neck pain in a different area. Dr. Dorey conducted a discogram, injecting fluid into McCub-bins\'s spine and taking an X-ray. Dr. Dorey did not recommend additional surgery; instead he referred McCubbins to a pain clinic in Anchorage employing Dr. Robert Swift. Dr. Swift prescribed narcotic medication for McCubbins\'s pain.\nB. Proceedings\nMcCubbins and Rona filed a complaint against the State of Alaska on October 26,
        1993, alleging that the State was negligent in failing to inspect the Big Lake site for dangerous conditions; warn of subsurface rocks or other dangerous conditions; and remove the submerged rock that McCubbins struck. McCubbins and Rona requested damages for medical expenses, pain and suffering, physical impairment, emotional distress, lost income and loss of consortium. The State answered on December 16,
        1993, asserting, inter alia, that McCubbins\'s .injuries were caused by his own negligence and that he had failed to mitigate his damages.\nTrial was held from January 23 to February 3, 1995. On the issue of damages, McCubbins presented his own testimony, Rona\'s testimony and the testimony of Dr. Dorey, Dr. Swift, eoworker Patrick Smith, employer James Doyle, vocational rehabilitation counselor Jill Friedman, and economist Francis Gllela. The State presented the testimony of physician\'s assistant Ed Manning, Dr. Taylor, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Douglas Smith, psychologist Dr. Michael Rose, and vocational rehabilitation counselor Richard Stone. On February 3 the jury found the State negligent for failing to maintain the Big Lake site in a reasonably safe condition. The jury also found McCubbins comparatively negligent and attributed 50% fault to him and 50% to the State. By special verdict, it awarded McCubbins $28,
        -800 for future medical expenses, $3,
        200 for past pain and suffering, and $18,
        000 for future pain and suffering. The jury awarded no damages for past medical expenses, past earnings, future earning capacity, past physical impairment, future physical impairment, and loss of consortium.\nBefore the jury was discharged, McCub-bins objected to the special verdict, arguing that it was inconsistent and should be resubmitted. The trial court discharged the jury, ruling that the issue could be addressed in post-trial motions. McCubbins then moved for a new trial on the issue of damages. The court denied McCubbins\'s motion, noting that the verdict was consistent with the evidence adduced at trial, except for the jury\'s failure to award damages for immediate post-accident expenses, for which the court later ordered additur. McCubbins moved for entry of final judgment and a new trial, this time alleging improper argument by the State. The trial court held oral argument on the motion for a new trial, but did not issue a second ruling.\nThe trial court issued a final judgment for McCubbins in the amount of $26,
        914.10, assessed prejudgment interest against the State at 5.5% pursuant to Civil Rule 68 and determined that the State was the prevailing party. The trial court ordered additur of $3,
        828.20 for "emergency medical care, physical therapy and evaluation" immediately following McCubbins\'s accident. McCubbins filed a motion for reconsideration on August 1. 1996, claiming that the State\'s offer of judgment was invalid and that the trial court should have found McCubbins to be the prevailing party. The trial court denied this motion and awarded the State attorney\'s fees of $17,
        348.70.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review\n"The grant or refusal of a motion for a new trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb a trial court\'s decision on such a motion except in exceptional circumstances to prevent a miscarriage of justice." Buoy v. ERA Helicopters, Inc.,
        771 P.2d 439,
        442 (Alaska 1989). The evidence must be "so slight and unconvincing as to make the verdict unreasonable and unjust." Hutchins v. Schwartz,
        724 P.2d 1194,
        1199 (Alaska 1986) (citing City of Whittier v. Whittier Fuel & Marine Corp.,
        577 P.2d 216,
        222 (Alaska 1978)). This court will uphold a refusal "if there is an evidentiary basis for the jury\'s decision." State v. Will,
        807 P.2d 467,
        469 (Alaska 1991) (citing Mullen v. Christiansen,
        642 P.2d 1345,
        1348 (Alaska 1982)).\nB. Did the Trial Court Abuse Its Discretion by Failing to Grant a New Trial on Damages ?\n1. Did the State violate the collateral source rule?\nIn November 1994 McCubbins filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude the State from introducing evidence of his health insurance "in any way." The trial court granted the motion "to the extent outlined at AS 09.17.070." McCubbins argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant him a new trial because the State improperly elicited testimony that his medical expenses were covered by insurance in violation of the collateral source rule. The exchange that McCubbins complains of took place during the State\'s cross-examination of Dr. Dorey.\nMcCubbins asserts that the jury "evidently believed that [his] past medical expenses had been paid for by his Teamsters\' insurance, but that he would need money for future expenses." McCubbins notes that the trial court recognized that an improper reference was made to a collateral source.\nRelying on Williams v. Utility Equipment, Inc.,
        837 P.2d 1112 (Alaska 1992), the State argues that McCubbins has waived this argument because he "did not make specific objections" when Dr. Dorey mentioned McCubbins\'s medical coverage during his cross-examination by the State. We agree. In Williams, the plaintiff, Williams, filed a motion asking the trial court to prohibit the defendant from using evidence of Williams\'s prior drug use. Id. at 1114. This motion was apparently granted. However, at trial the defense did introduce such evidence and Williams failed to object to it. On appeal, Williams argued that the trial court erred in violating its own protective order. We disagreed, holding that "Williams waived his objections, despite the protective order, when he did not make specific objections as the testimony [about his drug use] was presented." Id. at 1116-17.\nSimilarly, in the present case, although McCubbins\'s motion in limine preventing the State from introducing evidence of his health insurance was granted, McCub-bins never objected to the portion of the State\'s cross-examination of Dr. Dorey which had effectively elicited information about McCubbins\'s health insurance. Accordingly, because he did not make specific objections to the introduction of this evidence, McCub-bins has waived the issue on appeal.\n2. Did the State improperly argue that it was not responsible for subsequent medical negligence ?\nMcCubbins asserts that the State improperly argued that subsequent medical negligence by Drs. Dorey and Swift caused or exacerbated McCubbins\'s injuries, thus relieving the State of responsibility for these damages. Specifically, McCubbins points to the State\'s closing argument and its cross-examination of Dr. Dorey, which both suggested that Dr. Dorey negligently recommended McCubbins undergo the fusion surgery. However, McCubbins never objected to any of the State\'s allegedly improper arguments or questions of which he now complains. As such, he failed to preserve this alleged error on appeal. In Clary Insurance Agency v. Doyle,
        620 P.2d 194 (Alaska 1980), we held that appellants waived their claim about improper closing argument because they "failed to raise their objection in the trial court until the hearing on their motion for a new trial, long after the jury had reached its verdict." Id. at 204. We explained that "[ojbjections to statements made during closing argument must be given prior to the time the jury is instructed so that the court has an opportunity to instruct the jury to ignore the statement or to submit a corrective instruction." Id.; see also 58 Am. Jur.2d New THal  164 (1989) ("Generally, in order that a party may seek a new trial on the ground that counsel for the opposing party has made improper remarks or comments, the complaining party must have made a proper and timely objection to the statements, and sought to have the harmful effect thereof removed by an instruction to the jury"). Because he did not timely object to these statements, McCubbins has waived his arguments regarding subsequent medical negligence.\n3. Was the jury\'s verdict logically inconsistent?\nMcCubbins argues that the verdict is logically inconsistent because the jury awarded damages in some categories but failed to award them in "corresponding" categories. We agree that the jury\'s verdict awarding damages for future medical expenses but not for diminished earning capacity was inconsistent.\n"We will not disturb a jury verdict if there is a theory which reconciles the apparent inconsistencies." Yang v. Yoo,
        812 P.2d 210,
        215 (Alaska 1991). No logical theory exists for the jury\'s award of $28,
        800 for future medical expenses, but its failure to award anything for diminished future earning capacity. The jury\'s award of $28,
        800 for future medical expenses closely approximated the $28,
        600 cost for McCubbins\'s treatment at a pain management clinic, as estimated by his expert. Thus, it is very likely that the jury\'s award for future medical expenses was intended to cover the costs of McCubbins attending a pain management clinic, especially since one of the State\'s main arguments at trial was that McCubbins suffered from chronic pain syndrome. The State acknowledges this but argues that the jury could have reasonably concluded that attendance and participation in a pain management clinic would enable McCubbins to resolve his chronic pain problems without impairing his future earning capacity.\nThis argument fails to address the inconsistencies in the jury\'s verdict. The State\'s own witness, Dr. Smith, testified that pain clinic programs generally are "at least five days a week, eight hours a day," lasting for "four to eight weeks." Thus, by traveling to and attending such a clinic, McCubbins will necessarily miss at least four to eight weeks of work. His future earning capacity is diminished by at least the amount of money he would have made in the time necessary to complete a pain management clinic. The jury\'s failure to award any amount for loss of future earning capacity is therefore internally inconsistent with its award of $28,
        800 for future medical expenses. Thus, the superior court abused its discretion by not ordering a new trial on the issue of damages. Cf. State v. Lewis,
        785 P.2d 24,
        26-27 (Alaska 1990) (superior court abused its discretion in refusing to order a new trial given that the jury\'s verdict about the amount of just compensation owed to plaintiff was internally inconsistent).\nWe have held that "when an issue requiring reversal is fairly separable from the other issues involved in the case, we may grant a partial new trial, setting aside only so much of the judgment as is affected by error." Poulin v. Zartman,
        542 P.2d 251,
        275 (Alaska 1975). "The most typically separable issues are those of liability and damages." Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck,
        624 P.2d 790,
        795 (Alaska 1981) (citations omitted). Those issues are separable in the present case and therefore we order a new trial on the issue of damages only. Cf. Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc. v. Day,
        615 P.2d 621,
        624 (Alaska 1980) ("in this case the evidence on liability is almost entirely separate from the evidence on damages . (therefore,] [i]n order to limit the time and expenditure required by a new trial, we direct that there shall be a partial new trial" on the issue of liability).\nC. The State\'s Conditional Cross-Appeal\nThe State seeks a new trial on the issue of liability only in the event that we grant McCubbins\'s request for a new trial on damages. We reject the State\'s argument that it is entitled to a new trial.\n1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by excluding testimony relating to inspections of the swimming area?\nAccording to the State, Doug Soner-holm was a state-employed ranger who had the "primary day-to-day responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the Big Lake North Recreation Site" at the time of McCubbins\'s accident. Sonerholm resigned in June 1993 and began working for the Wasilla Police Department. The State\'s July 19,
        1994 witness list included Sonerholm as a potential fact witness. The State also notes that it identified Sonerholm in a response to an interrogatory. However, the State had difficulty contacting Sonerholm and did not speak with him until midway through the trial. The State notified McCubbins of the substance of this contact on January 25,
        1995, two days after the beginning of trial, through a supplemental interrogatory response.\nOn January 30,
        1995, McCubbins moved to exclude any testimony regarding "inspection of the subsurface or bottom of the Big Lake North Swimming Area," because the State had failed to disclose this information in response to "very specific" interrogatories. After hearing oral argument, the trial court concluded that the State\'s supplemental disclosure was untimely, although it noted that the State had not engaged in "intentional misrepresentation." The trial court concluded that McCubbins would be prejudiced by the late disclosure, because at this point in the trial, McCubbins had just completed his entire liability case-in-chief.\nThe trial court allowed the State to introduce Sonerholm\'s testimony that he had conducted inspections on shore and in a boat to discover litter and hazards such as broken glass, because it was consistent with the State\'s answers to McCubbins\'s interrogatories. Thus, the court only precluded Soner-holm from testifying that he inspected the lake for hazardous objects in hip waders.\nThe State asserts that it repeatedly attempted to contact Sonerholm in good faith and did not willfully violate the discovery process. Relying on Wasserman v. Bartholomew,
        923 P.2d 806,
        811-12 (Alaska 1996), it argues that any sanction was improper. McCubbins responds that allowing Soner-holm to testify that he inspected the lake in hip waders would have severely prejudiced his case because the State failed to disclose any evidence of such inspections until after McCubbins had completed his liability presentation to the jury.\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Sonerholm\'s testimony. The State\'s reliance on Wasserman is not persuasive. In Wasserman, we held that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of a non-party witness as a sanction because, under the circumstances, the witness\'s uncooperative behavior was not properly attributable to the sanctioned defendant. Wasserman,
        923 P.2d at 812-13. However, Wasserman also held that "[t]rial courts have the power to regulate the manner in which evidence is discovered and disclosed at trial. In extreme circumstances, a trial court may properly conclude that only exclusion of a non-party witness\'s testimony can redress the unfairness of the situation." Id. at 812.\nAlso, in State v. Guinn,
        555 P.2d 530 (Alaska 1976), we upheld the trial court\'s exclusion of a State Trooper\'s testimony because the State, the defendant on whose behalf the Trooper was going to testify, failed to produce the Trooper\'s notebook on which his testimony was to be based. Id. at 542-43. The trial court\'s exclusion of the Trooper\'s testimony was upheld even though the State\'s failure to produce the notebook was not in "bad faith" or a "purposeful deception." Id. at 543. Indeed, we explicitly rejected the State\'s argument that the trial court abused its discretion because "there was no showing of wilful recalcitrance" on the part of the State. Id. Thus, the fact that the State in the present case allegedly made good faith efforts to locate Sonerholm is not necessarily dispositive of the issue of whether the court abused its discretion in limiting his testimony. Accord Fairbanks N. Star Borough v. Lakeview Enterprises, Inc.,
        897 P.2d 47,
        58 (Alaska 1995) (citing Guinn for the proposition that "a showing of \'wilful\' disobedience was not required in order to preclude a witness\' testimony.").\nFinally, the trial court\'s sanction was narrowly crafted in that it merely excluded testimony inconsistent with the State\'s interrogatory responses. The trial court considered other lesser sanctions, concluding that an \'award of costs would not remedy the disadvantage to McCubbins if the State were allowed to introduce the testimony. Further, the sanction was carefully limited to the nature of the State\'s violation. The trial court only excluded testimony inconsistent with the State\'s interrogatory responses. It permitted the State to argue and elicit testimony that inspections for litter and hazards were routinely conducted from the shore and that litter was removed by canoe. Sonerholm did in fact testify at trial, and in closing argument the State emphasized that Sonerholm "paid special attention" to his routine inspections of the swimming area for "stuff in the water." Such narrowly tailored,
        "less drastic" measures have been previously upheld by this court. See, e.g., Lakeview Enterprises, Inc.,
        897 P.2d at 58; Guinn,
        555 P.2d at 543.\nOur holding that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of Sonerholm\'s testimony is also supported by other authority. See, e.g., Yukon Equip., Inc. v. Gordon,
        660 P.2d 428,
        432 (Alaska 1983) (upholding exclusion of specific testimony for failure to disclose in response to interrogatory); cf. Grimes v. Haslett,
        641 P.2d 813,
        822-23 (Alaska 1982) (holding that trial court has considerable discretion in excluding or limiting testimony); Drickersen v. Drickersen,
        604 P.2d 1082,
        1087 (Alaska 1979) (upholding trial court\'s exclusion of expert\'s new opinions offered for first time at trial).\n2. Was Jury Instruction Number 23 erroneous?\nThe State argues that the trial court improperly included the last sentence in Jury Instruction Number 23. The instruction read:\nPlaintiffs cause of action against the State is based upon and must meet the requirements of the law relating to the liability of a landowner for a dangerous condition of property.\nBefore the plaintiff may be entitled to your verdict against the State under this law, you must find from a preponderance of the evidence:\nFirst: That the Big Lake North Recreation Site, and specifically the swimming area at the recreation site, was in a dangerous condition on May 31,
        1993;\nSecond: That the injury of which plaintiff complains was proximately caused by the dangerous condition;\nThird: That the injury occurred in a way which was reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of the dangerous condition of the property; and\nFourth: That the dangerous condition had existed for a sufficient period of time or was so obvious, or both, that the State should have discovered and eliminated it.\nThe State had a duty to make reasonable inspections.\n(Emphasis added.) The State argues that the trial court misstated the law because the instruction implied that the State had the duty to inspect "each and every piece of remote land it owns."\nImplicit in the duty to discover and eliminate hidden dangers of a sufficient duration, which is set out in the "Fourth" part of Instruction 23, is the duty to make reasonable inspections. Thus the last sentence of the instruction did not impose a new duty on the State. As the propriety of the earlier part of the instruction is not challenged, the final sentence cannot be considered error.\nNor do we believe that the final sentence was error in the context of this case. We do not have here undifferentiated public land which people may utilize for recreational pursuits only at their own risk. In Kooly v. State,
        958 P.2d 1106 (Alaska 1998), we held that the State did not owe a duty of care to sledders who used state rights-of-way as sledding hills. We noted that although the hill where the accident occurred was commonly used for sledding, the State had not "formally dedicated the sledding hill as a recreational area." Id. at 1109. We also observed that it was "not possible to make the thousands of miles of state rights-of-way adjacent to highways safe for sledding." Id. Here, by contrast, the area in question was roped off for swimming and was part of a state recreation area. In Moloso v. State,
        644 P.2d 205,
        219 (Alaska 1982), a case involving a state construction area, we observed that landowners have a duty to warn entering persons of hidden dangers of which the entering persons are unaware. Implicit in this duty is a duty to inspect for hidden dangers. Such a duty should properly apply to designated use areas like the swimming area involved in this case.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe jury\'s verdict awarding damages for future medical expenses and not for diminished future earning capacity was inconsistent. Accordingly, McCubbins\'s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages should have been granted. No error was committed which requires a new trial on liability, including apportionment of fault. Therefore, we REMAND for a new trial on damages and VACATE the rulings regarding the prevailing party determination and decreased prejudgment interest.\n. Because Rona sued only for loss of consortium, only Woody McCubbins is referred to as "McCubbins" throughout this opinion, unless otherwise indicated.\n. AS 09.17.070(a) provides:\n(a) After the fact finder has rendered an award to a claimant, and after the court has awarded costs and attorney fees, a defendant may introduce evidence of amounts received or to be received by the claimant as compensation for the same injury from collateral sources that do not have a right of subrogation by law or contract.\n. The dialogue occurred as follows:\nQ Now I have one other record from your office from September 30th that indicates after your one-and-a-half hour appointment with Mr. McCubbins that you had obtained authorization from the Teamsters to proceed to surgery and that you had also obtained authorization from the Teamsters to waive a second opinion. Do you have that record?\nA Yes.\nQ What I\'m asking you is during the course of your one-and-a-half hour appointment with Mr. McCubbins on the 30th of September you had accomplished a telephone call to the Teamsters authorizing surgery and advising Mr. McCubbins to waive obtaining a second opinion before surgery. Is that a correct reading of that note?\nA No.\nQ What\'s incorrect about it?\nA Well, I didn\'t write it out here. My handwriting is at the top and this is one of my office persons.\nQ This is somebody on your staff?\nA Correct. And it said: "Called Teamsters, Susan, any hospital $100 deductible, 90 percent; called Beach Street." I think it is. ", . review, talked with Sharon at that number, second opinion waived." That does not mean that I waived a second opinion, that means that . the insurance company didn\'t require a second opinion, they felt that they didn\'t need another opinion, that my opinion was enough to authorize it.\n. Despite the waiver, we may still review the alleged error by the trial court under the plain error standard. However, that standard, which requires a "high likelihood" that the alleged error will result in a "miscarriage of justice," see Jaso v. McCarthy,
        923 P.2d 795,
        800 (Alaska 1996) (citations omitted), is not met here. Even if the trial court did err, the error was harmless because prior to the State eliciting information about McCubbins\'s medical coverage, McCub-bins\'s own attorney elicited information from McCubbins and his employer that revealed to the jury that McCubbins had medical coverage.\n. McCubbins also argues that the State should be barred from propounding a "mitigation of damages" theory for the first time on appeal since it neither raised this issue before the trial court nor requested a jury instruction on this theory. This argument has no merit. The State raised the affirmative defense that McCubbins had failed to mitigate his damages in its answer, the issue was arguably the State\'s primary defense on the damage issue, and a mitigation instruction was given to the jury. Jury Instruction Number 31 provided:\nPlaintiff is not entitled to be paid for any loss or for part of any loss he could have avoided with reasonable efforts and without undue risk, hardship or embarrassment, even though the loss originally resulted from an act or omission for which the defendant is legally responsible. If you decide that it is more likely true than not true that plaintiff could have avoided any loss or part of any loss with reasonable efforts and without undue risk, hardship or embarrassment, you may not require the defendant to pay the amount plaintiff could have reasonably avoided.\nIn these instructions I have asked you to decide in two separate contexts whether the plaintiff\'s actions were reasonable and I want to make sure you understand the difference. Earlier I told you how to decide whether the plaintiff\'s failure to use reasonable care caused plaintiff\'s loss. If you decide it did, you were asked to compare the plaintiff\'s negligence with the negligence, if any, of the defendant. Now I am asking you to decide whether after the loss occurred, the plaintiff failed to use reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid the loss. If you decide (he/she) did, then you may not compensate for the loss which could have been reasonably avoided.\n. The superior court\'s additur order did not redress the inconsistency of the jury\'s verdict because the additur focused on past medical expenses, not future earning capacity.\nBecause we order a new trial on damages based on McCubbins\'s argument that the jury\'s award for loss of future earning capacity was inconsistent with its award for future medical expenses, we find it unnecessary to address his other arguments about the inconsistency of the verdict. Nor do we address his claims that the damages award was inadequate, that the trial court erred in holding that the State was the prevailing party, or that the trial court erred in awarding decreased prejudgment interest pursuant to Civil Rule 68.\n. McCubbins argues that the State cannot raise this issue because it "failed to request a new trial on the issue of liability in its points on appeal." This argument is without merit. The State, in its points on appeal, did "specifically reserve[]" for review the issues it now argues on appeal "in the event a new trial is granted for the McCubbins."\n. The substance of the response is as follows:\nRequest: Please list which rangers or other state employees were responsible for patrolling the Big Lake North, East Wayside area in 1993.\nResponse: Prior to Mr. McCubbins\' injury on Memorial Day, the following park staff worked at Big Lake North State Recreation Site:\nDistrict Ranger Dennis Heilces\nArea Ranger Doug Sonerholm\nVolunteer Hosts Ned and Fay Johnson\n.The State also argues that the trial court improperly relied on Civil Rule 11 in imposing this sanction. McCubbins responds that the trial court did not rely on Rule 11 to impose the sanction. Although the trial court mentioned that Rule 11 "makes it clear that counsel are responsible for the facts that they\'re promoting in litigation," the court went on to explain that the State\'s response to McCubbins\'s interrogatory "was incorrect and incomplete compared to what Mr. Sonerholm presently is expected to say." It seems clear to us that the sanction was imposed pursuant to Civil Rule 37. See Wasserman,
        923 P.2d at 811 (noting that "[although the court did not explicitly cite Civil Rule 37 in its ruling, the principal source of sanctions for inadequate discovery responses is Civil Rule 37.").', 'OPINION\nMANNHEIMER, Judge.\nTwo state troopers came to McNeill\'s house to investigate an on-going domestic disturbance between McNeill and his wife. Just as the troopers were about to begin questioning McNeill, he ordered them to "get the hell out" of his house. The troopers refused to leave until McNeill explained what was going on. The primary issue presented in this appeal is whether, under these circumstances, the troopers were obliged to administer Miranda warnings to McNeill before they questioned him. As explained below, we conclude that McNeill was not in custody for Miranda purposes at this time, and therefore the troopers did not need to advise McNeill of his rights.\nThe Miranda issue\nLate in the evening of December 8,
        1997, Steven A. McNeill got into a fight with his wife, and his wife called 911. Two state troopers were dispatched to the McNeill residence in response to this call. When they arrived, McNeill\'s wife was still on the phone to the 911 dispatcher. Ms. McNeill met the troopers outside the residence and told them that her head hurt; she said that McNeill had thrown his coat at her and that something hard in the coat pocket had struck her in the head. One of the troopers examined Ms. McNeill\'s head and observed swelling and bruising. Ms. McNeill also told the troopers that, because of her fear of her husband, she had armed herself with a handgun. However, Ms. McNeill then declared that her head injury was the result of an accident and that it was "no big deal".\nThe troopers decided to speak with McNeill (who was still inside the house). McNeill at first invited the troopers into the house, and he does not claim that their entry constituted a trespass. But McNeill soon reconsidered his decision; he told the troopers to "get the hell out of [his] house and leave [him] alone." Given the circumstances, the troopers refused to leave until they could determine what was going on between McNeill and his wife. The troopers told McNeill, "[We] will [leave] as soon as you tell [us] what\'s going on."\nIn the ensuing conversation, McNeill told the troopers that he had "tossed" his coat at his wife, and that a hard object in the pocket (which McNeill identified as "a couple of CD-ROMs") struck his wife in the head. The troopers believed that McNeill might have assaulted his wife, but they nevertheless gave him the option of leaving the house rather than being arrested. McNeill would have none of this; he refused to leave and instead demanded to be arrested. He also insisted that the troopers arrest his wife because she had pointed a gun at him. After the troopers concluded to their satisfaction that McNeill had been the initial aggressor, they arrested him for fourth-degree assault.\nMcNeill was tried in the district court. In the middle of his trial, McNeill asked District Court Judge Herschel E. Crutchfield to suppress the statements he made to the troopers on the evening of his arrest — in particular, his statement that he had tossed his coat at his wife. McNeill claimed that he had been in custody during his conversation with the troopers, and he argued that his statements should be suppressed because the troopers had not given him Miranda warnings.\nBecause McNeill waited until trial to make this motion, and because he failed to offer any reason for waiting so long to make the motion, McNeill apparently forfeited his right to raise this suppression issue. See Alaska Criminal Rule 12(b)(3) and (e). Nevertheless, Judge Crutchfield allowed McNeill to litigate his motion. Following a hearing, the judge concluded that McNeill had not been in custody when he conversed with the troopers; the judge therefore refused to suppress McNeill\'s statements.\nOn appeal, McNeill argues that he was obviously in custody, since the troopers suspected him of assaulting his wife and because they refused to leave him alone and get out of his house. But the fact that McNeill may have been the focus of police suspicion does not mean that he was in custody for Miranda purposes.\nMcNeill points to the fact that the troopers refused to leave his house until he talked to them. Generally, in determining whether a person is in custody for Miranda purposes, a court must ask whether,
        "under the circumstances of the police interaction with the suspect, . a reasonable person [would] have felt free to break off the interrogation and, depending on the location, either leave or ask the police to leave ". McNeill relies on this last phrase of the custody test; he contends that he was obviously in custody because the troopers openly refused to leave his house when he asked them to.\nBut this formulation of the Miranda custody test is somewhat inexact. This wording suggests that Miranda warnings will be required whenever a person is "seized" for Fourth Amendment purposes, but that is not the law. The cases applying Miranda recognize that there are some Fourth Amendment seizures of temporary duration — most notably, routine traffic stops and other investigative stops — in which Miranda warnings are not required, even though the person is temporarily in custody and the police can properly ignore a request that the officers depart and leave the person alone.\nTo the extent that there was a Fourth Amendment seizure in McNeill\'s case, that seizure was of temporary duration for investigative purposes, and it fell short of Miranda custody. The troopers had plenty of reason to intervene at the McNeill household and investigate what was going on. They had come to the McNeills\' home in response to Ms. McNeill\'s 911 call. A domestic disturbance was either ongoing or had just ended. McNeill\'s wife had suffered a head injury, and she told the troopers that she had armed herself with a handgun. To confuse matters, Ms. McNeill claimed that her husband had injured her accidentally, and that the occurrence was "no big deal". Thus, when the troopers went into the house to speak to McNeill, it was still unclear what had happened. Moreover, the officers could reasonably suspect that the domestic disturbance might continue or escalate if they left without investigating. We hold that, under these circumstances, the troopers were entitled to remain in the house temporarily and question McNeill without giving him Miranda warnings.\nIn reaching this decision, we are mindful of two previous cases in which we held that defendants who were subjected to investiga-five questioning inside their houses were, in fact, held in custody for Miranda purposes. In Moss v. State and Higgins v. State , police officers\'with guns drawn forcibly entered a residence and maintained control over the people inside the home while the officers conducted a search. Even though the police announced that the defendants were not under arrest, the officers subjected the defendants to lengthy questioning. In both eases, although we conceded that the issue was close, we held that the defendants had been in Miranda custody when they were questioned.\nMcNeill\'s case is different. The troopers\' approach to McNeill was peaceable; they made no show of force, and they gave no other indication that they wished to arrest McNeill or detain him for a lengthy period. Quite the opposite. Although the troopers insisted on finding out "what [was] going on", they actively told McNeill that they did not wish to arrest him. The troopers in fact suggested that, although McNeill might be guilty of assault, they were willing to forego an arrest if McNeill would promise to leave the residence for the rest of the night.\nIn assessing whether an investigative stop has ripened into Miranda custody, we must ask whether, from the point of view of a reasonable person in the defendant\'s position, "[the] stop\' exerts . pressures that sufficiently impair [the defendant\'s] free exercise of the privilege against self-inerimination to require that [the defendant] be warned of his constitutional rights". McNeill was not subjected to such pressures. The troopers therefore could question McNeill without giving him Miranda warnings.\nAs an alternative basis for our decision, we also note that the troopers had been called to the scene of an ongoing domestic disturbance. McNeill\'s wife was injured, and she told the troopers that she had armed herself with a handgun because of hr fear of her husband. It was still unclear what had happened, or what might happen if the troopers left. Under the "on-the-scene questioning" exception recognized by this court in McCracken v. State , the troopers\' initial request for McNeill to "tell [them] what [was] going on" did not qualify as "interrogation" for purposes of the Miranda rule.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the district court properly denied McNeill\'s suppression motion.\nMs. McNeill\'s \'prior consistent statement\nMcNeill raises one other issue in this appeal: he claims that he was improperly prevented from introducing hearsay evidence of statements his wife made at his arraignment.\nMcNeill was arraigned approximately thirteen hours after his arrest. At the arraignment, Ms. McNeill asked that the assault charge against her husband be dropped. She declared that McNeill had not hurt her. She also declared that her head injury had been caused by accident when she was struck by a set of keys in McNeill\'s coat pocket. According to Ms. McNeill, her husband had not intentionally struck her; rather, she "just happened to be in the way of the coat".\n(As explained in the first section of this opinion, Ms. McNeill told this same basic story to the troopers who arrived in response to her 911 call. Specifically, she told the troopers that her head injury was the result of an accident and that it was "no big deal".)\nMs. McNeill was called as a witness at McNeill\'s trial, and she testified that her husband had not assaulted her. Ms. McNeill explained that she and her husband had been arguing and that her husband, with coat in hand, had gestured with his arm. In making this gesture, Mr. McNeill had "turned loose of the coat", and the coat then collided with Ms. McNeill\'s head.\nTo counteract this exculpatory testimony, the prosecutor asked Ms. McNeill a series of questions suggesting that she had altered her account of the incident in order to help her husband\'s defense. Then, responding to this attack on Ms. McNeill\'s credibility, McNeill\'s attorney asked permission to introduce Ms. McNeill\'s statements at her husband\'s arraignment as prior consistent statements under Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(B).\nJudge Crutchfield refused to allow the defense to introduce Ms. McNeill\'s statements at the arraignment. However, the judge did allow defense counsel to elicit testimony (a) that Ms. McNeill had made prior statements about the occurrence, (b) that she made these statements before her husband hired a lawyer to defend him, and (c) that these statements were consistent with her trial testimony.\nOn appeal, McNeill contends that he should have been allowed to introduce his wife\'s specific statements from the arraignment. But even if this were true, we conclude that McNeill was not prejudiced by the claimed error. During Ms. McNeill\'s trial testimony, the jury heard her explain that she had been injured by accident when she was struck by an object in her husband\'s coat. In addition, one of the two troopers who responded to the 911 call testified that Ms. McNeill had said basically the same thing on the night of the occurrence — that her injury was caused accidentally when her husband tossed his coat at her and she was hit by a hard object in the coat pocket. Thus, the jury was provided with particularized evidentiary support for Ms. McNeill\'s assertions that she had made prior statements about the incident and that these statements were consistent with her trial testimony.\nOn this record, we are convinced that even if Judge Crutchfield\'s ruling was error, that error did not appreciably affect the jury\'s decision of this case.\nConclusion\nWe have concluded that the troopers did not need to give Miranda warnings to McNeill. We have further concluded that the jury\'s verdict was not appreciably affected by any error in the trial court\'s ruling concerning Ms. McNeill\'s prior consistent statements. Accordingly, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n. AS 11.41.230(a).\n. See Miranda v. Arizona,

On the union\'s employment priority listings appellant was assigned to List A, which afforded him the right to prior employment over members assigned to Lists B and C. In this action appellant alleged that in violation of his right to priority in employment he was not referred to employment to which he was entitled, whereas members on Lists B and C were so referred. As a result, appellant contends, he suffered a loss of $45,
        000 in wages during the years 1961,
        1962 and 1963. He sought that amount in this action as compensatory damages, together with $50,
        000 in punitive damages.\nAppellant\'s complaint was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and he brought this appeal. The question presented is whether state jurisdiction over this dispute between appellant and appellees has been pre-empted by federal law which vests in the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction over labor relation matters affecting interstate commerce.\nIn speaking of its decision in San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, etc. v. Garmon, the United States Supreme Court, in Local 100, of United Ass\'n of Journeymen, etc. v. Borden, said:\nThis Court held in San Diego Building Trades Council, etc. v. Garmon,
        359 U.S. 236,
        79 S.Ct. 773,
        3 L.Ed.2d 775, that in the absence of an overriding state interest such as that involved in the maintenance of domestic peace, state courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board in cases in which the activity that is the subject matter of the litigation is arguably subject to the protections of  7 or the prohibitions of  8 of the National Labor Relations Act. This relinquishment of state jurisdiction, the Court stated, is essential \'if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted,\' 359 U.S., at 245,
        79 S.Ct. at 780, and is as necessary in a suit for damages as in a suit seeking equitable relief. Thus the first inquiry, in any case in which a claim of federal preemption is raised, must be whether the conduct called into question may reasonably be asserted to be subject to Labor Board cognizance. [Footnote omitted.
        ]\nHere appellant contends that no such assertion can be made. We disagree. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act grants to employees the right to self-organization, to form, join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and "to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection _ jt js arguable that the union\'s alleged conduct in failing or refusing to adhere to the employment priority listings so far as appellant was concerned was in violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act by restraining appellant in the exercise of a right guaranteed in Section 7, that is, the right to participate in a hiring hall arrangement which could have resulted from a concerted activity engaged in by union employees for their mutual aid and protection. As the United States Supreme Court said in the Borden case "[t
        ]he problems inherent in the operation of union hiring halls are difficult and complex and point up the importance of limiting initial competence to adjudicate such matters to a single expert federal agency."\nIn holding as we do that the alleged union actions concerning appellant\'s employment opportunities or relations may reasonably be subject to the National Labor Relations Board cognizance, we do not consider whether appellant\'s rights under the hiring hall arrangements in this case were federally protected on the theory we have suggested, or on some other basis. All that we hold is that it is reasonably arguable that the matter comes within the jurisdiction of the Board, and therefore that the state courts must yield jurisdiction and leave the alleged conduct of the union to be judged by the only federal agency vested with exclusive primary jurisdiction to apply federal standards.\nRelying on the United States Supreme Court\'s decision in International Ass\'n of Machinists v. Gonzales, appellant argues that the facts here relate to purely internal union matters, and therefore that the state\'s jurisdiction is not preempted by federal law.\nGonzales involved a suit against a labor union by an individual who claimed that he had been expelled from the union in violation of his contractual rights. He sought restoration of membership and also consequential damages flowing from the expulsion, including loss of wages resulting from loss of employment. It was recognized that a restoration of union membership was a remedy that the National Labor Relations Board could not afford and that the internal affairs of unions were not in themselves a matter within the Board\'s competence. The Court stated:\nBut the protection of union members in their rights as members from arbitrary-conduct by unions and union officers has not been undertaken by federal law, and indeed the assertion of any such power has been expressly denied. The proviso to  8(b) (1) of the Act states that \'this paragraph shall not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein _>\nIn speaking of the Grnales decision in Borden, the Court said:\nThe Gonzales decision, it is evident, turned on the Court\'s conclusion that the lawsuit was focused on purely internal union matters, i. e., on relations between the individual plaintiff and the union not having to do directly with matters of employment, and that the principal relief sought was restoration of union membership rights. In this posture, collateral relief in the form of consequential damages for loss of employment was not to be denied.\nWe believe that the facts of this case do not come within the Gonzales rationale. This suit is not focused on purely internal union matters not having to do with matters of employment as in Gonzales, but on the contrary it is focused principally if not entirely on the union\'s actions with respect to appellant\'s efforts to obtain employment. As in Borden, the crux of this action concerns appellant\'s employment relations and, as we have held, involves conduct arguably subject to the Board\'s jurisdiction. Gonzales is distinguishable and is not controlling.\nAppellant\'s complaint stated that the ap-pellees Foley and Learned were joined as defendants both personally and as representatives of the union. Appellant argues that by suing those appellees personally, they are not being charged with an unfair labor practice proscribed by Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, but instead with a common law tort over which the Board has no jurisdiction but over which the court below did have jurisdiction.\nBoard jurisdiction is not precluded by the mere fact that the complaint alleges that the union agents are also being sued individually. Such an allegation does not change the fact that appellees were agents of the union at the times referred to in the complaint. Their alleged conduct in not referring appellant for employment according to hiring hall rules and practice, whether done as individuals or as union agents, was the kind of conduct that was arguably subject to Sections 7 and 8 of the Act — the kind of conduct that "must be free from state regulation if national policy is to be left unhampered." It is conduct "whose lawfulness could initially be judged only by the federal agency vested with exclusive primary jurisdiction to apply federal standards." The exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board may not be circumvented by an al legation in a complaint in a state court that activities of union agents of the kind arguably subject to Board jurisdiction were engaged in by such agents in their capacities as individuals, rather than as agents of the union.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n.

Resolution of the merits of this proceeding turns upon whether the Board of Governors of the Alaska Bar Association correctly decided that petitioner had not "been engaged in the active practice of law for at least five out of the previous six years". The Board of Governors concluded that "[t
        ]he work performed by applicant for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service does not constitute \'rendering legal services\' within the meaning of AS 08.08.245(3)." We affirm the Board\'s decision and hold that petitioner is not entitled to admission to the Bar of Alaska under the reciprocity provisions of AS 08.08.140.\nPetitioner was born in 1904 at Hailey, Idaho, and graduated from Albion High School, Albion, Idaho, in May of 1924. In February 1927, petitioner graduated from Albion State Normal Teachers College, Albion, Idaho, and received a "Life Diploma." Thereafter, petitioner undertook and completed his study of law by correspondence courses from LaSalle Extension University, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1938. After successfully completing a written bar examination, petitioner was, on December 2, 1938, admitted to the practice of law in the State of Montana.\nFrom the time of his admittance to the Bar of Montana in 1938, until December of 1964, petitioner\'s employment was exclusively with the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Following his retirement from this agency, petitioner served as a judge for the District Court of the State of Alaska at Sitka from August 1965 until February 1967.\nThe question of whether the nature of the services which petitioner rendered to the Immigration and Naturalization Service were, in fact, "legal services" within the purview of AS 08.08.245(3) is controlled by our recent decision in Application of Payne. There, as in the case at bar, we were required to determine if the services rendered by petitioner to the governmental agency were "legal services" under AS 08.08.245(3), and thus constituted the requisite "active practice of the law" for five out of the previous six years under AS 08.08.140. In Payne, we held that the term "rendering legal services,
        " as used in AS 08.08.245(3), requires that a petitioner seeking admission by reciprocity must have "devoted a substantial portion of his time and energies to the rendering of legal services,
        " extensive in scope, in his employed capacity with the government agency.\nOur review of the entire record in this case convinces us the Board correctly concluded that the nature of the work performed by the petitioner for the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not constitute "rendering legal services" within the meaning of AS 08.08.245 (3). We are of the opinion that petitioner\'s showing before the Board did not meet either of the criteria which we articulated in the Payne case. More particularly, petitioner\'s proof adduced to the Board did not demonstrate that he was required to, and in fact did, devote a substantial portion of his work time to the rendering of legal services to the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. On the basis of petitioner\'s showing, we are of the further view that petitioner\'s proof failed to disclose that the legal services which he did render were sufficiently broad in scope to qualify as "legal services" under AS 08.08.245(3). In short, the legal services which petitioner did perform were limited to the highly specialized areas of naturalization and citizenship matters. In light of the narrow range of petitioner\'s actual legal experience while in the employ of the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, we hold that the Board of Governors was warranted in reaching the conclusions of law which were entered in this matter.\nOn this record we cannot say that the Board of Governors of the Alaska Bar Association acted arbitrarily, unjustly, or erroneously in denying petitioner admission by reciprocity.\nPetitioner\'s application for admission to the Alaska Bar Association without examination is denied.\n. Reciprocity, as a method of obtaining eligibility for admission to the Bar of Alaska, is established by AS 08.08.140 of the Alaska Integrated Bar Act. This section of the Act provides:\nAn attorney in good standing in the bar of another state or territory or the District of Columbia which admits members of the Alaska Bar to the practice of law shall be admitted without examination and otherwise upon substantially the same terms and conditions as are fixed in the jurisdiction from which he has come for the admission of attorneys from this state. As a prerequisite to admission to the Alaska Bar the board shall require an attorney to take and pass an ex-examination, unless the applicant (1) has passed a state bar examination, (2) had engaged in the active practice of law for at least five out of the previous six years before filing the application, excluding time spent in the military service of the United States, (3) is a graduate of a law school accredited by the American Bar Association, or is a graduate of any law school if he received his degree before 1950 and began his legal studies before 1940, or has been engaged in the active practice of the law for at least 10 years, and (4) meets the character requirements established by the board.\n. AS 08.08.245(3) defines, in part, the term "active practice of law," as used in AS 08.08.140, as\nrendering legal services to an agency, branch, or department of a civil government in the United States or a state or territory of the United States, in an elective, appointive or employed capacity * ⅜\n. The Board of Governors found that petitioner\'s services with the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service consisted of the following:\na. Prom December, 1938, to March, 1941, as Naturalization Examiner in Federal and State District Courts in Montana.\nb. Prom December, 1945, to February, 1948, as Chief of Nationality and Status in Spokane, Washington.\nc. Prom February, 1948, until June, 1952, as Naturalization Examiner, in Helena, Montana.\nd.

Application of Payne, 430 P.2d 566 (Supreme Ct., Alaska, July 27, 1967).\n. In the ease at bar, petitioner filed his application for admission to the Alaska Bar Association by reciprocity on October 20, 1964. Due to subsequent events, his application was not considered until the May 5, 1966, meeting of the Board of Governors.\n. We, therefore, find that the record supports the Board\'s related conclusion of law to the effect that petitioner had failed to sustain his burden of proof in regard to the required number of years of active practice of law.\n. In Application of Payne, 430 P.2d 556 (Supreme Ct., Alaska, July 27, 1067), we said:\nWe are of the further view that petitioner\'s proof discloses that the scope of the legal services which he performed were not so \'narrow\' as to be disqualified from constituting \'legal srevices\' under AS 08.08.245(3) or \'active practice of law\' under the reciprocity provisions of AS 08.08.140.\nIn this court petitioner argues that on the basis of his testimony before the Board of Governors, six exhibits attached to his brief, and the provisions of 8 U.S.O.  1103, 1154, 1225, 1429, 1446, and 1447 (1964) it was "conclusively established that [he
        ] was engaged in rendering legal services ."\n.Petitioner is eligible to be admitted to the Alaska Bar Association if he successfully completes a written bar examination.', 'OPINION\nBRYNER, Chief Judge.\nRobert J. Ross was convicted by a jury of one count of kidnapping and five counts of first-degree sexual assault. He later entered a plea of no contest to a separate charge of second-degree sexual assault. Superior Court Judge Peter A. Michalski sentenced Ross to consecutive sentences totalling eighty-four years\' imprisonment. Ross appeals his kidnapping and first-degree sexual assault convictions, contending that the trial court erred in denying a continuance to allow Ross to find a missing defense witness. Ross also challenges his composite sentence as excessive. We affirm Ross\' convictions but remand for further findings on his sentence.\nRoss\' convictions stem from two incidents that occurred approximately a week apart. On January 30,1987, Ross met V.B. in a downtown Anchorage bar; at Ross\' invitation, V.B. and several friends accompanied Ross to his nearby house for some beer. There, after V.B.\'s friends left, Ross physically and sexually assaulted V.B.\nOn February 6, 1987, Ross approached S.A. in a downtown Anchorage bar, grabbed her arm, and commanded her to do as she was told. He forced S.A. to walk to his house. There, Ross held S.A. hostage for approximately eight hours, repeatedly subjecting her to physical and sexual assaults. In the early morning hours of February 7, S.A. managed to escape Ross\' house and ran to the house of an acquaintance, William Jones. She woke Jones up, told him she had been raped, and asked for help. Jones went back to sleep, telling S.A. he would help her later. Afraid to go outside alone, S.A. remained at Jones\' house. Later that afternoon, Jones awoke and took S.A. to the home of her fianc; S.A. immediately told her fianc that Ross had raped her. Her fianc took her to the hospital, where she was examined and reported the crime.\nS.A.\'s examination revealed that one of her front teeth had been broken out and that S.A. had suffered other physical injuries consistent with her claim of rape. The examining physician found semen in the area between S.A.\'s vagina and rectum. Serology tests later established that the semen was consistent with Ross\' semen. S.A. provided the police with an accurate description of Ross, showed them where he lived, and later identified him from a photographic lineup. A search of Ross\' house yielded S.A.\'s missing tooth.\nFor his January 30 assault on V.B., Ross was initially charged with three counts of first-degree sexual abuse. For his February 6-7 abduction and assaults on S.A., Ross was charged with kidnapping and five counts of first-degree sexual assault (three counts alleging acts of vaginal penetration and two of anal penetration).\nThe charges involving S.A. came on for trial before those involving V.B. Boss\' basic theory of defense was alibi. On October 27, 1987, as part of its case, the prosecution called William Jones as a witness. Jones confirmed that S.A. had awakened him early one morning. He testified that S.A. appeared to have two missing front teeth, a black eye, and bruises on her arms and legs. She was extremely upset and scared. S.A. asked for help, saying she had been raped. Jones stated that, after going back to sleep for awhile, he took S.A. to her fianc\'s house.\nAfter subjecting Jones to a perfunctory cross-examination, Ross\' trial counsel indicated that he had no further questions at that time but wanted Jones held under subpoena for possible testimony during the defense case. The trial court told Jones that he was still under subpoena and that he should remain available to testify.\nOn November 4, 1987, six days after Jones testified as a prosecution witness, the state rested its case-in-chief. Ross\' counsel then requested an overnight continuance, indicating that the delay was necessary because he had been unable to locate Jones, whom he now wanted to call as a defense witness. The trial court granted the continuance and adjourned court until the next day.\nOn the morning of November 5, Ross\' counsel notified the court that Jones was still missing. An Alaska State Trooper who was in the courtroom described the efforts that the troopers had made to locate Jones since the court recessed the previous day. Those efforts included checking Jones\' last known residence and all of the downtown Anchorage locations that he frequented, as well as contacting various Anchorage police officers who were acquainted with Jones and other individuals who knew him. All efforts had been unavailing. The troopers also followed up on a lead that Jones might have gone to Bethel; they transmitted a facsimile of Jones\' subpoena to the Bethel Police Department and spoke by telephone to the Bethel Chief of Police, requesting assistance. The Bethel Police had been unable to locate Jones.\nRoss\' counsel then requested an additional continuance until November 9. He revealed that he expected Jones to impeach S.A.\'s version of events. According to Ross\' counsel, Jones would testify that, when S.A. came to his house, she appeared to have been drinking and did not say who had raped her. Ross\' counsel also expected Jones to testify that, at some point before Jones took S.A. to her fianc\'s house, Jones and she had sexual intercourse together.\nAlthough the prosecution expressed skepticism concerning the materiality of Jones\' proposed testimony, the trial court granted Ross a further continuance until November 9. On that day, however, Jones was still missing. Troopers and police had been unable to locate him or develop any significant leads as to his whereabouts, despite exhaustive efforts. Ross\' counsel acknowledged that the defense had no idea where Jones might be or when he might be found.\nRoss requested an additional continuance of several days. Alternatively, Ross moved for a mistrial due to Jones\' unavailability. In support of these motions, counsel elaborated on the offer of proof that he had originally made, indicating that the offer was based on statements Jones had made to a defense investigator. Ross\' counsel asserted that the proposed testimony would be relevant to discredit S.A.\'s testimony that she was not intoxicated when she came to Jones\' house and that she told Jones who had raped her. Ross\' counsel also asserted the relevance of Jones\' claim that he had sexual intercourse with S.A. at his house. According to counsel, this evidence might explain the presence of semen on S.A.\'s person; counsel also asserted that S.A.\'s claim of abduction and rape might seem less plausible to the jury if S.A. were shown to have engaged in consensual sex a short time after the alleged incident.\nJudge Michalski denied Ross\' motion for an additional continuance and his alternative motion for a mistrial. In so doing, the judge noted the exhaustive efforts that had been made to locate Jones, the lack of any information concerning Jones\' current whereabouts, and the inability to predict when Jones might be located. Judge Mi-chalski found that further delay might result in the need to declare a mistrial. Additionally, the judge noted that Jones\' proposed testimony was, at best, impeachment evidence. Based on his observation of Jones\' demeanor as a prosecution witness, Judge Michalski commented that his testimony was unlikely to carry much weight with the jury, in any event. Judge Michal-ski concluded that, under the circumstances, additional delay was unwarranted; the judge further found a mistrial inappropriate, since the uncertainty about Jones\' whereabouts made it impossible to predict that Jones would be available to testify for the defense, even in the event of a retrial. On appeal, Ross contends that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a further continuance or a mistrial.\nThe trial court is vested with broad discretion to determine whether a mid-trial continuance should be granted in order to allow a party to secure the testimony of an absent witness. See, e.g., Williams v. State, 614 P.2d 1384, 1386 (Alaska 1980). In Salazar v. State, 559 P.2d 66 (Alaska 1976), the Alaska Supreme Court articulated seven criteria to guide the court in the exercise of that discretion:\n(1) whether the testimony is material to the case;\n(2) whether the testimony can be elicited from another source;\n(3) whether the testimony is cumulative;\n(4) probability of securing the absent witness in a reasonable time;\n(5) whether the requesting party was diligent and acted in good faith;\n(6) the inconvenience to the court and/or others; \'\n(7) the likelihood that the testimony would have affected the jury\'s verdict.\nId. at 72.\nUnder the Salazar criteria, the threshold question in this case is the materiality of Jones\' proposed testimony. Jones would purportedly have testified that S.A. appeared to have been drinking and did not identify her assailant. Although this testimony would have tended to contradict S.A.\'s trial testimony, thereby impeaching her credibility, the subject matter of the impeachment was essentially collateral to the principal issues raised in the case: whether S.A. had been abducted and raped and whether Ross was the person who had committed these offenses. As extrinsic evidence offered to impeach a witness on a collateral matter, the proffered testimony would have been of minimal materiality.\nJones would also purportedly have testified that S.A. had consensual sex with him after coming to his house. Assuming that Alaska\'s rape shield statute would not have barred the admission of this testimony for the purpose of establishing an alternative source for the semen discovered on S.A. during her medical examination, the materiality of this aspect of Jones\' testimony would have been greatly diminished by medical evidence indicating that the semen found on S.A. was compatible with Ross\' semen. Ross failed to offer any comparable medical evidence establishing Jones as a possible source of the semen. Moreover, the state presented strong physical evidence (including S.A.\'s broken tooth) corroborating S.A.\'s version of the incident, and established that S.A. had identified Ross from a photographic lineup. Under the circumstances, the trial court could properly regard the materiality of Jones\' proposed testimony as being limited, at best.\nThe second and third Salazar criteria have no significant bearing here, since both assume the materiality of the unavailable evidence: the fact that Jones\' proposed testimony was not cumulative and was unavailable from alternative sources is inconsequential in light of its low materiality.\nIn contrast, the fourth Salazar criterion is of critical importance. Even if Jones\' testimony had only slight probative value, a brief delay might have been warranted had there been some assurance of Jones\' availability. Here, however, Jones\' whereabouts remained completely unknown despite concerted efforts to locate him, and no significant leads had been developed. Under the circumstances, the trial court, having already granted two continuances for a total of five days\' delay, had no reason to expect that any further delay— no matter how long or short — would have resolved the problem.\nAll other things being equal, the fifth Salazar criterion — the diligence and good faith of the moving party — would tend to favor Ross in this case, since Judge Michal-ski expressly ordered Jones to remain available as a possible defense witness, and since Jones apparently violated the court\'s order. Even so, it is worth mentioning that Ross had the opportunity to elicit the proffered evidence during his cross-examination of Jones, but apparently elected not to do so for tactical reasons.\nSalazar\'s sixth criterion focuses on inconvenience to the court and others. In the present case, Judge Michalski expressed the well-grounded fear that additional delay would create a substantial risk of problems that might necessitate a mistrial. When balanced against the speculative prospects for locating Jones, this risk was certainly not insubstantial.\nFinally Salazar requires consideration of the likelihood that Jones\' testimony would have affected Ross\' verdict. In large measure, the significance of this factor is governed by our conclusion concerning the materiality of the disputed testimony. The relatively low probative value of the proffered evidence, coupled with the strength of the physical evidence corroborating S.A.\'s testimony, renders it highly unlikely that Jones\' absence affected the outcome of Ross\' trial, particularly in light of Judge Michalski\'s impression — based on his observation of Jones as a prosecution witness— that the jury was unlikely to give his testimony much credence.\nIn summary, our application of the Salazar criteria to this case convinces us that Judge Michalski did not abuse his discretion in denying Ross\' third motion for a continuance.\nRoss next challenges his sentence as excessive. At the time of his current offenses, Ross was 35 years of age. Ross had one prior felony: a 1982 conviction for first-degree sexual assault that involved circumstances similar to the assaults Ross committed against V.B. and S.A. For the earlier crime, Ross received an eight-year term; he was on parole for that offense when he committed the current offenses.\nFor the incident involving S.A., Ross was convicted of kidnapping and five counts of first-degree sexual assault. Kidnapping, an unclassified felony, is punishable by a maximum term of 99 years and a minimum of five; the crime is not subject to presumptive sentencing. AS 11.41.300(c); AS 12.55.125(b). First-degree sexual assault, also an unclassified felony, is punishable by a maximum of thirty years; as a second felony offender, Ross was subject to presumptive terms of fifteen years for each of his first-degree sexual assault convictions. AS 11.41.410(b); AS 12.55.125(i)(3).\nFor the incident involving V.B., Ross was convicted of one count of second-degree sexual assault, a class B felony. He was subject to a four-year presumptive term for that offense. AS 11.41.420(b); AS 12.55.-125(d).\nBefore imposing sentence, Judge Michal-ski found one aggravating factor applicable to all of the charges as to which Ross was subject to presumptive sentencing: that Ross was on parole when he committed the offenses. AS 12.55.155(c)(20). As to two of the first-degree sexual assault convictions, Judge Michalski found an additional aggravating factor: that Ross\' conduct involved deliberate cruelty. AS 12.55.-155(c)(2). Additionally, although presumptive sentencing did not formally apply to the charge, Judge Michalski found Ross\' kidnapping to involve conduct among the most serious included in the definition of the offense. AS 12.55.155(c)(10).\nIn imposing sentence, Judge Michalski concluded that Ross was an extremely dangerous offender who had little chance for rehabilitation. The judge thus stressed the need to isolate Ross for the protection of the community. Judge Michalski sentenced Ross to fifty years for kidnapping. The judge imposed fifteen years for each count of first-degree sexual assault, making the two counts involving anal penetration concurrent to each other and the three counts involving vaginal penetration concurrent to each other, but ordering each group of concurrent sentences to be consecutive to the other group, as well as to the kidnapping. This yielded a total of eighty years\' imprisonment for the offenses involving S.A.\nFor the second-degree sexual assault conviction involving Y.B., Judge Michalski imposed an additional consecutive term of four years. Relying on Ross\' dangerousness and the need to isolate him for the maximum possible time, Judge Michalski ordered that Ross\' eligibility for discretionary parole be restricted on the kidnapping charge. Ross thus received a composite term of eighty-four years without possibility of parole.\nOn appeal, Ross does not challenge the aggravating factors Judge Michalski found applicable to his case. He argues, instead, that a composite term of 84 years is excessive for a second felony offender convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault. In response, the state argues that Ross\' sentence is justified in light of his background and the seriousness of his current crimes. In our view, however, the sentencing court\'s findings are inadequate to allow resolution of this issue on appeal.\nThis court recently had occasion to conduct an extensive review of past sentencing decisions involving offenders simultaneously convicted of rape — or first-degree sexual assault — and kidnapping. See Williams v. State, 800 P.2d 955 (Alaska App.1990), modified on reconsideration, 809 P.2d 931 (Alaska App.1991). Our review indicated "a fair degree of uniformity" in sentencing in such cases. Williams, 800 P.2d at 958. We noted that the cases fell into three benchmark categories. The initial category consisted of first felony offenders. For offenders in this category, we observed that sentences exceeding twenty years of unsuspended time had rarely been approved. Id. at 959. The second benchmark category included kidnap/rape cases involving offenders who had one or more prior felony convictions but whose criminal history was not sufficiently extensive to place them in the dangerous offender category. As to this category, we found that "precedents firmly establish thirty years as the maximum composite sentence that should ordinarily be imposed...." Id. In the third benchmark category, we found "a handful of decisions" approving composite sentences of more than thirty years of un-suspended time; we observed that "[without exception, those cases have involved kidnappings of prolonged duration or offenders whose prior criminal histories established them as persistent, violent criminals." Id. at 960.\nIn a later opinion on reconsideration in Williams, we emphasized that these three benchmarks do not represent immutable sentencing limits: "Our benchmarks in Williams and other cases are not intended to be inflexible rules confining the permissible range of a sentence in a given case; rather, they are meant to act as historically-based starting points for individualized analysis_" Williams v. State, 809 P.2d 931, 933 (Alaska App.1991). Indeed, shortly after our initial decision in Williams, we found departure from the benchmarks justified, approving a forty-year composite sentence for a second felony offender in a particularly serious kidnap/rape case that involved three separate incidents and three different victims. See Yearty v. State, 805 P.2d 987, 996-97 (Alaska App.1991).\nOur opinion on reconsideration in Williams nevertheless reaffirmed the fundamental need for consideration of historical sentencing practices — as reflected in benchmark sentences — in the sentencing process; we noted that this need springs from the legislature\'s concern with promoting sentencing uniformity and eliminating unjustified disparity — a concern the legislature expressed with "unmistakable clarity" in AS 12.55.005(1), which requires the sentencing court to consider "the seriousness of the defendant\'s present offense in relation to other offenses." Williams, 809 P.2d at 934. We concluded:\nAt a minimum, . the principle of reasonable sentencing uniformity requires a sentencing judge who decides that an offender deserves a sentence which is significantly different from sentences previously given to similarly situated offenders to expressly find some legitimate basis for the difference — some basis related to \'legally relevant sentencing criteria.\' That basis should be spelled out on the sentencing record, so that the defendant and a reviewing court can understand the reasons for the disparity.\nId. at 935 (citation omitted).\nIn the present case, Ross\' composite sentence of eighty-four years without eligibility for parole vastly exceeds the second felony offender benchmark and, indeed, substantially exceeds even the sentences imposed in some of the cases falling within Williams\' third benchmark category. Unlike other offenders in Williams\' third benchmark category, Ross\' criminal history — consisting of a misdemeanor conviction for driving while intoxicated and a single prior felony, albeit for a similar crime — is not so extensive as to qualify him as an habitual offender, see, e.g., Contreras v. State, 767 P.2d 1169, 1175 (Alaska App.1989), and does not appear to "establish an ingrained, compulsive criminal pattern" of violent misconduct. Schuenemann v. State, 781 P.2d 1005, 1009 (Alaska App.1989). And unlike other cases in the third benchmark category, Ross\' kidnapping did not entail an extraordinarily lengthy abduction. See, e.g., Morrell v. State, 575 P.2d 1200, 1202-03 (Alaska 1978) (virtual enslavement of victim with repeated sexual assaults over eight days).\nDespite the seemingly unprecedented length of the composite term he imposed in this case, Judge Michalski failed to discuss the seriousness of Ross\' conduct in relation to other similarly situated offenders. Although the judge gave general consideration to the sentencing criteria specified in State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441, 444 (Alaska 1970), he made no findings to explain the apparent disparity between Ross\' composite sentence and sentences previously given to similarly situated offenders.\nIt seems to us that the aggravated nature of Ross\' conduct and the disturbing similarity of his prior sexual assault make his case at least comparable to, and perhaps more serious than, Yearty v. State. We are thus inclined to think that a sentence exceeding Williams\' second category benchmark of thirty years would be justified here, as was the case in Yearty. On the other hand, given Ross\' limited criminal history, we are skeptical that a sentence placing Ross in the third benchmark category could be justified, particularly in light of the sketchy psychiatric information contained in the sentencing record.\nAt this juncture, however, it would be premature for us to determine whether the sentence imposed below was excessive. DeGross v. State, 768 P.2d 134, 138 (Alaska App.1989). "A reviewing court cannot determine the appropriateness of a sentence where the sentencing court has failed to make adequate findings.... " State v. Bumpus, 820 P.2d 298, 305 (Alaska 1991). Here, the sentencing court\'s failure to make express findings concerning the seriousness of Ross\' offenses in relation to other similar cases and the court\'s consequent failure to explain the apparent disparity of the sentence it elected to impose preclude meaningful appellate review. We must therefore remand this case for resen-tencing in light of Williams. On remand, the sentencing court should make express findings in conformity herewith.\nThe convictions are AFFIRMED. The sentences are VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentencing.\nMANNHEIMER, J., not participating.\n. After being found guilty by a jury of the charges relating to S.A., Ross entered a plea of no contest to a reduced charge of second-degree sexual assault for the incident involving V.B.; in exchange for the plea, the state dismissed the original charges.\n. See AS 12.45.045.\n. Compare, e.g., People v. Martinez, 634 P.2d 26 (Colo.1981), with State v. Williams, 773 P.2d 1368 (Utah 1989).\n. Indeed, the record contains nothing to suggest that Jones\' whereabouts were in fact discovered at any time prior to Ross\' sentencing, while jurisdiction of his case remained in the superior court and that court retained the power to grant a new trial. Similarly, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Jones has been located during the pendency of Ross\' appeal or that he would be available to testify in the event of a retrial.\n. Nor does Ross\' conduct appear to have exposed his victims to the type of imminent, life-threatening danger that justified an exceptionally severe first-offense sentence of thirty years in Wilson v. State, 670 P.2d 1149, 1154 (Alaska App.1983). See also Williams v. State, 800 P.2d at 958.\n. The record contains a 1981 psychiatric evaluation prepared in connection with Ross\' prior sexual assault case. The evaluation appears to have been based on an interview by a social worker to determine Ross\' personal history, coupled with a single psychiatric interview. There is no indication that Ross was subjected to any psychological testing. Under the heading "diagnosis," the psychiatric evaluation lists alcohol abuse and antisocial personality disorder. Although the report discusses Ross\' alcohol abuse problem extensively and makes specific recommendations for treatment thereof, it is virtually silent concerning the basis for diagnosing an antisocial personality disorder, the nature of the disorder, or its significance in terms of Ross\' overall conduct. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Michalski did not make any specific reference to the psychiatric evaluation. On appeal, however, the state notes that Ross has been diagnosed as having an antisocial personality disorder and, apparently on this basis, argues that he has psychological problems justifying skepticism concerning his prospects for rehabilitation. In our view, however, it is questionable whether any significance should properly be ascribed to the psychiatric report\'s single, cryptic reference to a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder.', 'OPINION\nMANNHEIMER, Judge.\nWayne E. George was convicted of first-degree murder, AS 11.41.100(a)(1), first-degree robbery, AS 11.41.500(a)(3), and second-degree theft, AS 11.46.130(a)(3), following a jury trial in the Ketchikan superior court. For these crimes, George received a composite sentence of 106 years\' imprisonment. George appeals both his convictions and his sentence. We affirm.\nDuring the evening and early morning of June 29-30, 1989, George and three friends were out drinking in Ketchikan. They wandered throughout the town and ended up behind Talbot\'s Building Supply. There, a fisherman named Michael Tarbet joined them. George and his friends shared some of their tequila with Tarbet, and Tarbet shared some marijuana with George and the others. Then George began to kick and punch Tarbet, not stopping until Tarbet was semi-conscious. George took $11.00 from Tarbet\'s wallet and left Tarbet lying on the dock.\nA short time later, one of George\'s companions urged him to go back to "do the job right and finish him off." George returned to the dock where Tarbet lay, then he rolled Tarbet into the water and watched him sink.\nOne month later, on July 21, the Alaska State Trooper Tactical Diving Unit discovered Tarbet\'s body. That same day, George was arrested in nearby Metlakatla for a liquor law violation. Metlakatla Police Officer Larry Lower brought George to the Metlakatla Police Department, where he read George his Miranda rights and placed him in a cell.\nGeorge paced back and forth in his cell, repeatedly saying that he needed to talk to someone. Officer Lower called George\'s pastor at the Metlakatla church, Reverend Blewett, asking him to come to the police department. After placing this call, Lower left to return to his patrol duties.\nGeorge spoke with his pastor for ten to fifteen minutes. After Reverend Blewett left, George asked the jailer, Officer Little-field, whether Littlefield had heard about the recovery of a body in Ketchikan. Lit-tlefield replied that he had not heard about it. George then told Littlefield that he was the one who had pushed that person over the dock, and that he wanted to speak to Officer Lower. Littlefield summoned Lower back to the police department.\nLower immediately contacted the Alaska State Troopers to verify that a body had been found in Ketchikan. The troopers confirmed that they had found a body; they gave Lower a description of Tarbet and the place where he had been found. Lower then returned to George, re-read him the Miranda rights, and obtained George\'s written waiver of those rights. George confessed to Lower that he had killed the person recently found in Ketchi- kan; George described Tarbet and the details of how he had met his death. Lower did not record this interview because his tape recorder was broken.\nLower contacted the Ketchikan Police Department and informed them of George\'s confession. Ketchikan Police Sergeant Lee Meyer flew to Metlakatla the next day to interview George. Sergeant Meyer again read George his Miranda rights, and George again signed a written waiver of his rights. George then repeated much of what he had told Littlefield and Lower. However, George deviated from his prior statements in one crucial respect: he told Meyer that he had not pushed Tar-bet into the water, but rather had hidden him on the dock behind some pallets.\nFollowing his indictment by a Ketchikan grand jury, George moved to suppress his statements to Littlefield, Lower, and Meyer. George argued that his initial statement to Littlefield should be suppressed because he had not been advised of his Miranda rights. He argued that his follow-up statement to Officer Lower should be suppressed because Lower had violated the rule announced in Stephan v. State, 711 P.2d 1156 (Alaska 1985), by failing to tape record his interview with George.\nSuperior Court Judge Thomas E. Schulz found that George had been advised of his Miranda rights shortly after his arrest. Moreover, Judge Schulz ruled that George\'s statements to Littlefield were volunteered, not the product of custodial interrogation; thus, even if George had received no Miranda warning, his statements to Littlefield would still be admissible. George has not appealed this ruling.\nWith regard to George\'s statement to Lower, Judge Schulz ruled that the taping requirement announced in Stephan did not apply to the Metlakatla police, since Metla-katla is an Indian reservation outside the normal jurisdiction of the Alaska police. Judge Schulz also ruled that, if the taping requirement applied to the Metlakatla police, the taping requirement was excused because the testimony at the suppression hearing showed that the Metlakatla police\'s tape recorder was broken when Lower interviewed George. Finally, Judge Schulz ruled that the Stephan rule did not apply to George\'s case because George had failed to assert that any impropriety occurred during his interview with Lower, apart from Lower\'s failure to tape the interview.\nOn appeal, George renews his argument that his statements to Littlefield and Lower should have been suppressed for violation of the Stephan taping rule. Both George and the State have devoted considerable energy to arguing whether Alaska law governing police procedures (and, specifically, the Stephan rule) applies to the Metlakatla police. We find it unnecessary to resolve this issue.\nThe Stephan rule applies only to custodial interrogations. Stephan, 711 P.2d at 1162. Judge Schulz found, and George does not dispute, that George\'s statements to Littlefield were not the product of custodial interrogation. See Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689-1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Thus, the admission of George\'s statements to Littlefield does not violate Stephan.\nWith regard to George\'s statements to Lower, Judge Schulz found that the Met-lakatla police did not have a functioning tape recorder. This fact excuses non-compliance with the Stephan rule. Stephan, 711 P.2d at 1164. More importantly, Stephan does not prohibit admission of a defendant\'s custodial statement "if no testimony is presented that the statement is inaccurate or was obtained improperly, apart from violation of the [taping
            ] rule." Id. at 1165. On appeal, George does not contend that, apart from Lower\'s failure to tape the interview, there was any impropriety in his interview with Lower. Thus, George\'s statements to Lower are admissible under Stephan.\nWe turn now to George\'s sentencing arguments. Judge Schulz sentenced George to a term of 99 years\' imprisonment for his first-degree murder conviction and a consecutive term of 7 years\' imprisonment for his first-degree robbery conviction. (Judge Schulz imposed an additional 2-year sen tence for the second-degree theft, but he made this sentence concurrent with the robbery sentence.) Thus, George\'s total sentence is 106 years\' imprisonment.\nGeorge argues that his 99-year sentence for first-degree murder is excessive. In Riley v. State, this court rejected a proposed benchmark sentence of 60 years\' imprisonment for first-degree murder, noting that Alaska decisions "have consistently approved the imposition of maximum sentences" for this offense. 720 P.2d 951, 952 (Alaska App.1986). Judge Schulz found that George\'s act of killing Tarbet was premeditated and deliberate. The homicide thus would have qualified as first-degree murder even under the more stringent, common-law definition found in Alaska\'s former criminal code. Riley, 720 P.2d at 952 n. 1. George\'s conduct therefore presents a particularly serious form of first-degree murder.\nMoreover, Judge Schulz found that, when George returned to kill Tarbet, George knew that Tarbet was particularly vulnerable due to his intoxication and the effects of George\'s previous attack. If first-degree murder were governed by presumptive sentencing, this would be an aggravating factor under AS 12.55.155(c)(5). (Judge Schulz found that the first-degree robbery was aggravated by this factor.) In addition, George\'s psychological evaluations indicated that he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder with aggressive and paranoid features, a type of disorder that is difficult to treat.\nJudge Schulz\'s remarks at sentencing show that he analyzed George\'s offense under the criteria established in State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970), and concluded that a maximum sentence was justified because of the seriousness of George\'s crime, the need to reaffirm social values, George\'s poor potential for rehabilitation, and the need to isolate George to protect the public from further acts of violence. We do not find George\'s 99-year sentence to be clearly mistaken. McClain v. State, 519 P.2d 811, 813-14 (Alaska 1974).\nGeorge also argues that, even if his murder sentence is justified, Judge Schulz should not have imposed an additional 7 years\' imprisonment for the robbery. Judge Schulz decided to impose consecutive sentences for the robbery and the murder because these crimes involved distinct societal interests and because, under the facts of this case, the robbery and the murder were distinct events. After committing the robbery and leaving Tarbet incapacitated, George walked away from the dock; he returned later for the specific purpose of killing the helpless Tarbet. Judge Schulz justifiably viewed the robbery and the murder as two separate crimes deserving separate punishments. See Cooper v. State, 595 P.2d 648 (Alaska 1979) (one assault on three victims; sentence greater than the maximum term for one count of assault); Preston v. State, 583 P.2d 787 (Alaska 1978) (unrelated crimes; sentence greater than the maximum term for the more serious crime); Farmer v. State, 746 P.2d 1300 (Alaska App.1987) (one assault on three victims plus unrelated crimes; sentence greater than the most severe presumptive term); Jones v. State, 744 P.2d 410 (Alaska App.1987) (one assault on three people; sentence greater than the most severe presumptive term).\nJudge Schulz recognized, however, that Alaska law restricts a sentencing judge\'s authority to impose consecutive sentences that exceed the maximum sentence permitted for the defendant\'s most serious crime:\nTHE COURT: [The fact that the robbery and the murder were distinct crimes] does not necessarily mean that the sentences should exceed . 99 years, because the court has said in a number of cases that ., in cases that involve multiple felony convictions, . you start off with the presumption that you sentence on the most serious felony and then only exceed that [maximum sentence] when you can make the finding that the defendant needs to be incarcerated — isolated to protect the public.\nHere, Judge Schulz is referring to Mutschler v. State, 560 P.2d 377, 381 (Alaska 1977), and its progeny. See, for example, Ross v. State, 808 P.2d 290, 292-93 (Alaska App.1991).\nHaving recognized the applicability of this case law, Judge Schulz premised his decision to sentence George to a total of 106 years on specific findings that George was a dangerous offender who had committed a particularly serious type of first-degree murder, that George did not have a favorable outlook for rehabilitation, and that therefore George needed to be isolated for more than 99 years to protect the pub-lie. This decision was not clearly mistaken. McClain, 519 P.2d at 813-14.\nThe judgement of the superior court is AFFIRMED.\n. George relies on language from Thompson v. State, 768 P.2d 127 (Alaska App.1989), where this court indicated in dictum that a sentence exceeding 99 years\' imprisonment should not be affirmed unless the trial court has found that, in order to protect the public, "the defendant must spend the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of parole". 768 P.2d at 133-34. George interprets this language to mean that sentencing judges must make a finding over and above the requirements of Mutschler v. State, 560 P.2d 377, 381 (Alaska 1977). To the extent that such an interpretation is possible, it was unintended.\nThompson cited two cases to support the "life without parole" language: Nukapigak v. State, 663 P.2d 943 (Alaska 1983), and Hastings v. State, 736 P.2d 1157 (Alaska App.1987). Both cases involved defendants who were sentenced to several consecutive 99-year terms and who, therefore, were clearly going to spend the rest of their lives in prison without ever becoming eligible to apply for parole. AS 33.16.100(d). However, George (like the defendant in Thompson) received a total sentence of slightly more than 100 years, with normal eligibility for parole. George was 21 years old at the time of his sentencing, and thus he will be eligible for parole well before he turns 60. AS 33.16.090(c) and AS 33.16.100(c)-(d). Judge Schulz was not required to find that a sentence of life without parole was necessary to protect the public since George did not receive such a sentence.', 'OPINION\nBURKE, Justice.\nThe appellants, all Alaska Native fishermen, began their action in superior court alleging that emergency orders issued by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Department) and regulations promulgated by the Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) discriminated against them because of their race. After a bench trial, the superior court entered judgment against the state, finding that the Department and Board had violated AS 18.80, the Alaska Human Rights Act. The superior court, however, awarded the plaintiffs only declaratory relief.\nThe plaintiffs have appealed three aspects of the superior court\'s decision: (1) the court\'s finding that they did not prove compensatory damages with reasonable certainty; (2) the court\'s ruling that punitive damages are not available against the state for violations of AS 18.80, the Alaska Human Rights Act; and (3) the superior court\'s refusal to accord issue preclusive effect to the findings and conclusions in an order of the Alaska Human Rights Commission. We reverse the superior court\'s decision on compensatory damages and remand for a redetermination of damages on the present record. We affirm the court\'s ruling on punitive damages. We reverse the court\'s decision on issue preclusion and modify the judgment accordingly.\nFinally, the superior court decided that sovereign immunity does not bar actions for compensatory damages against the state under AS 18.80. The state appeals that decision. We affirm.\nI\nA\nAlaska Native fishermen from the Tlingit community of Yakutat, in southeast Alaska, fish for salmon in the rivers of their region and in the ocean surf.\nAt the mouths of the Alsek and East Alsek rivers, fifty miles south of Yakutat, surf fishing is especially hazardous. As a result, the inriver sites on the Alsek and East Alsek are distinctly preferable. The Yakutat fishermen, however, rarely venture far upstream on either of these rivers. On the Alsek and East Alsek, the better inriver sites are the territory of white fishermen. Several factors contribute to the racial division at the Alsek and East Alsek, but the most important of these is the territorial hostility shown by some white fishermen. Evidence indicates that the white fishermen began driving the Native fishermen downstream early in this century. By 1931, the Native fishermen rarely fished further upstream than the rivers\' mouths. There is no doubt that over the years the inriver fishermen have resorted to violence, including use of firearms, to maintain control of the inriver sites.\nTwo agencies share the main responsibility for managing the Alsek and East Alsek salmon fisheries: the Department of Fish and Game and the Board of Fisheries. The primary concern of both agencies is insuring that sufficient numbers of migrating salmon escape the gear of fishermen and continue on to spawn each year. Measuring escapement on the Alsek River presents especially difficult problems. To begin with, the Alsek is well over one hundred miles long, but only the last twenty miles flows within Alaska. The remainder of the river and its headwaters are in Canada. Additionally, the Alsek water in Alaska is heavy with silt, and early estimates of escaping salmon are often inaccurate. By contrast, escapement in the East Alsek River is much easier to measure, because the river is only three and one-half miles long, clear and entirely within Alaska. Not surprisingly, the state employs different management techniques at each of the rivers: Regulators may respond quickly to local indications of poor escapement on the East Alsek, but they generally must wait until definitive data on total escapement arrives from Canada at the end of the fishing seasons before they can adjust limits on the Alsek.\nThe Board is a policy-making agency; it promulgates regulations that, among other things, designate areas and times for fishing, size and type of gear, and minimum distances between units of gear. The Department is more of a policy-implementing agency, providing specific, on-site management of salmon stocks during the fishing season. For example, the Department conducts ongoing studies of salmon escapement during fishing season, and, to protect the salmon stocks, may issue emergency orders that restrict the area and the time within which fishing may occur at any given fishery. Several Department officials share the power to issue such orders in any particular fishing area. The hierarchy of Department officials with this power in the Yakutat area includes a Regional Supervisor, a Finfish Management Coordinator for Southeastern Alaska, and an Area Management Biologist for the Juneau Management Area. These officials are based in Juneau. The area management biologist occasionally visits the Yakutat area during fishing season. Otherwise, for on-site information and recommendations regarding regulation of the Yakutat fisheries, the Department officials in Juneau are mainly dependent upon a fourth official: the person who has been fishery technician in the Yakutat area since 1961, Alex Brogle.\nThroughout his tenure in Yakutat, Alex Brogle openly despised the Yakutat surf fishermen. The superior court concluded after trying this case:\nBrogle displayed a reservation mentality that led him to the view that the Yakutat natives should stay in fisheries close to town and not venture to the Alsek and East rivers where they would interfere with the commercial harvesting activities of people for whom Brogle had higher regard. Unquestionably Brogle was not disposed to manage the Alsek and East river fisheries in such a way as to preserve, to the extent possible, equality of opportunity to catch fish.\nThe "people for whom Brogle had higher regard," of course, were the white, inriver fishermen.\nBrogle\'s supervisors at the Department clearly knew of Brogle\'s racist and discriminatory bent; Brogle\'s weekly and seasonal reports to Juneau typically contained racist slurs, especially slurs attacking the Yaku-tat natives. Nonetheless, by all accounts, Brogle exercised significant influence over the Department\'s management of the Al-sek and East Alsek rivers. Brogle\'s influence was especially apparent in the Department\'s response to the crisis in the Alsek fishery that followed the 1978 and 1979 salmon runs.\nIn 1978 and 1979, the number of persons fishing in the surf and at inriver sites on the Alsek and East Alsek increased dramatically. For example, eighteen people fished the Alsek in 1977, twenty-nine in 1978, and thirty-eight in 1979. Not surprisingly, 1979 saw a record catch of red salmon in the area. Five years earlier, in the 1974 season, the number of fishermen in the area had reached a previous all-time high. This suggested that there might be a repercussive effect in 1979, among salmon returning to their spawning waters five years after hatching there. Nonetheless, initial Department measurements showed that an acceptably large number of fish were escaping in 1979. Later, however, data from Canada proved that the Department had been wrong in respect to the Alsek River; final figures showed that the 1979 escapement on the Alsek was "disastrously low." By the time the Department learned of its error, of course, the regulatory agencies could only respond by regulating the 1980 season on the Alsek.\nAlex Brogle recommended to his supervisors that the best response to the emergency would be to close the surf fishery at the Alsek, to limit fishing inriver to two days per week, and to make adjustments as necessary during the season. He justified his solution by arguing that the recent increase in surf fishing was a primary cause of the problem. Brogle\'s recommendations became public on May 7, 1980, when two members of the Board of Fisheries held an open meeting in Yakutat. Four Department officials attended the meeting, including Paul Larson, the Finfish Management Coordinator for Southeast Alaska, and Bro-gle. Some fifteen to twenty local fishermen and some members of the Yakutat Advisory Board also attended the meeting.\nBrogle explained his proposal to the assembly. The Yakutat residents countered with a proposal that included reduced gear size and limited open surf fishing to within one-half mile of the river mouths. The Department officials admitted that either their solution or a solution similar to the local residents\' counter-proposal probably would work. Evidence shows, however, that Department officials disfavored the gear reduction proposal in part because it would protect the native surf fishermen at the expense of the inriver white fishermen. As the Area Management Biologist Don Ingledue wrote, one week later, in a memorandum to another Department official:\nThe [Department] staffs position is that either management approach would be acceptable from a resource conservation standpoint. A regulatory emergency does not exist that would je[o]p[a]rdize the resource since we do have emergency order powers limiting time and area. However, any adjustments in gear size would have to be instituted under the Emergency Regulatory Authority of the Commissioner and the Board of Fisheries.\nThe gear reduction approach would benefit the local residents more than the management plan originally proposed by the staff. Again it should be pointed out that only local Yakutat fishermen were present at the meeting and many Alsek River fisherman had no knowledge of the meeting since they reside out of state and community.\nIngledue sent copies of this memorandum to Larson and Brogle.\nExactly two weeks after Ingledue sent his memo, on May 27, 1980, Larson issued Emergency Order No. l-Y-1-80, which banned surf fishing in the area that encompassed the Alsek and East Alsek river mouths and which limited inriver fishing to two days per week. The order took effect on June 2, 1980, and ran through June 22, 1980, when Ingledue issued Emergency Order No. l-Y-2-80, which lifted the ban on surf fishing. The new order explained: "The early portion of sockeye [red salmon
            ] run is now past and effort in the Alsek- East River area has declined.... Shifting of the river mouth sand bar has reduced the past efficiency of the net gear in [the surf
            ] area and the closure is no longer necessary."\nIn late 1980, the Board of Fisheries adopted the surf closure at the Alsek and East Alsek rivers as part of a permanent regulation affecting "all rivers south of the Dangerous River." The new regulation also limited gear length and reduced the maximum number of allowable nets per fisherman for part of the season. Importantly, the regulation also directed the Department to open, by emergency order, the surf fishery at the East Alsek River during the peak week of the red salmon run. The partial opening of the surf was necessary, in the Board\'s opinion, to avoid violence between the inriver fishermen and the Ya-kutat native fishermen. According to Larson, the Board\'s sense of the likelihood of violence was in part due to testimony that the board had heard from surf fishermen who said that, with the surf fishery closed, "they were afraid to go fish in [the Alsek and East Alsek
            ] rivers."\nUnfortunately, the emergency opening of the East Alsek surf fishery from July 20 to August 9,1981, was interrupted by a fierce storm, which forced surf fishermen to abandon some nineteen nets. Alex Brogle subsequently claimed that the abandoned nets killed and wasted a "tremendous" number of fish. Ultimately, two separate tribunals — the Human Rights Commission and the superior court — both concluded that the storm-tangled, abandoned surf nets had not, in fact, caused much waste of fish. At the time, however, Brogle\'s claims of waste in 1981 were instrumental in convincing the Department to keep the East Alsek surf fishery closed during the peak period in 1982.\nOn May 27, 1983, the Alaska Human Rights Commission enjoined the Department and the Board of Fisheries "from issuing and/or enforcing any regulation, order, or other official measure closing the surf at the Alsek or East Rivers at times when fishing within these rivers is allowed." On June 19, 1983, the state opened the Alsek and East Alsek surf fisheries. The record indicates that no surf fishermen worked in the Alsek surf in 1983, but that a few did fish in the East Alsek surf that year.\nB\nWalter Johnson, one of the surf fishermen, filed a complaint with the Commission on July 7, 1980, alleging that the Department\'s first emergency order closing the surf fishery discriminated against him and other native surf fishermen on the basis of their race. The state filed an answer in November 1981; substantial discovery followed; and the Commission conducted a hearing in Yakutat on April 19, 1982. The Commission hearing officer, (now Judge) Joan M. Katz, issued a decision on January 21, 1983, in which she concluded that the state "has discriminated against plaintiff in violation of AS 18.80.255(1) [of the Alaska Human Rights Act
            ] and . injunctive relief should issue." The hearing officer specifically found that Alex Brogle\'s "recommendations formed the basis for official actions,
            " and his racial prejudice against the natives "infected the entire process" of fishery regulation. On May 27, 1983, the three Human Rights Commission members unanimously adopted the hearing officer\'s proposed decision as a final order. The state did not appeal the Commission\'s order, as it was entitled to do under AS 18.80.135.\nMeanwhile, on March 13, 1981, the surf fishermen had filed a complaint in the superior court seeking "an injunction, damages, and other appropriate relief," pursuant to AS 18.80.255, 42 U.S.C.  1983, and the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution. In April 1984, after the Commission\'s order issued in the parallel case, the state filed an amended answer in which it asserted nine affirmative defenses. The most important of these defenses invoked various theories of sovereign immunity, including state immunity from punitive dam ages. The surf fishermen filed an amended complaint on January 2, 1986, adding a reference to the Commission findings, an allegation that surf fishing was "part of the heritage of Yakutat Alaska natives," and a new count based on article I, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution.\nThe surf fishermen next moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Commission\'s final order precluded relit-igation of the state\'s liability under AS 18.80.255. The state, in turn, moved for summary judgment, arguing that sovereign immunity, state immunity from punitive damages, and state immunity from suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 barred the surf fishermen\'s claims.\nThe superior court denied, without comment, the surf fishermen\'s motion for partial summary judgment. The superior court also denied part of the state\'s motion for summary judgment, finding that the state was not immune from suit under the Alaska Civil Rights Act. The superior court, however, granted part of the state\'s summary judgment motion, holding that the state was immune from liability for punitive damages and that, as a "nonperson," the state was not subject to liability under 42 U.S.C.  1983.\nAccordingly, in November 1987, the parties proceeded to a five-week bench trial, before Judge Thomas M. Jahnke, on the remaining issues in the case. On May 3, 1988, Judge Jahnke issued a memorandum of decision in the case. In sum, the superi- or court found that the state\'s closures of the surf fishery constituted a facially neutral practice that had no disparate impact on the native fishermen because they were still "free to fish all the remaining open waters." On the other hand, the superior court found that a "facially neutral practice that did have a substantial discriminatory impact . was the promulgation of the surf closures and restrictions without creating any mechanisms to resolve the conflicts between inriver and surf fishermen that were certain to occur." The superior court refused to find liability based on implied causes of action under the federal and state constitutions, but did find that the state had violated AS 18.80.255 of the Human Rights Act. The superior court further found that the surf fishermen had failed to show either the existence or extent of lost profit damages. Accordingly, the superior court awarded the surf fishermen only declaratory relief.\nThe surf fishermen have appealed nearly all of the rulings and findings and awards adverse to them in this case except the dismissal of their federal law claims. The state has cross-appealed on several points, most importantly on the superior court\'s ruling on sovereign immunity.\nII\nThe superior court determined two questions of law before trial when it ruled on the parties\' motions for summary judgment. Both determinations involved pure questions of law, and we review the superior court\'s decisions on those questions de novo.\nA\nArticle II, section 21 of the Alaska Constitution provides that "[t
            ]he legisla ture shall establish procedures for suits against the state." In 1966, the legislature amended the Alaska Human Rights Act to include AS 18.80.255, which provides, in relevant part:\nIt is unlawful for the state or any of its political subdivisions\n(1) to refuse, withhold from or deny to a person any local, state or federal funds, services, goods, facilities, advantages or privileges because of race, religion, sex, color or national origin; .\nCh. 79,  1, SLA 1966. In 1970, the legislature added a new subsection to AS 22.10.-020, the statute that establishes the original jurisdiction of the superior court, to permit actions under AS 18.80 in the superior court:\nThe superior court is the court of original jurisdiction over all causes of action arising under the provisions of AS 18.80_ In an action brought under this subsection, the court may grant relief as to any act, practice or policy of the defendant which is prohibited by AS 18.80_ The court may enjoin any act, practice or policy which is illegal under AS 18.80 . and may order any other relief, including the payment of money, that is appropriate.\nAS 22.10.020(c), enacted by Ch. 240,  1, SLA 1970 (currently AS 22.10.020(i)).\nAs the superior court noted when it denied summary judgment on this point, and as the surf fishermen argue on appeal, AS 18.80.255(1) and AS 22.10.020, taken together, appear to constitute express legislative consent for persons to bring particular civil rights actions against the state. We agree.\nThe state argues that, notwithstanding the consent to suit effect of the statutes quoted above, the extent to which the state may be liable under AS 18.80 ultimately depends upon application of yet another statute, AS 09.50.250. This third statute establishes the general rule that "[a
            ] person or corporation having a contract, quasi-contract, or tort claim against the state may bring an action against the state in the superior court." AS 09.50.250. The statute also, however, establishes state immunity from a variety of particular claims, among which are claims "for tort . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a state agency or an employee of the state, whether or not the discretion involved is abused." AS 09.50.250(1). According to the state, the Department and the Board of Fisheries exercised their discretionary powers when they chose to close the surf fisheries from 1980 to 1983. Thus, goes the argument, AS 09.50.250(1) bars the surf fishermen\'s claim against the state. We reject this argument.\nAs we repeatedly have explained, "[sjtate liability is the rule; immunity is the exception." Freeman v. State, 705 P.2d 918, 920 (Alaska 1985). The legislature specifically provided for actions against the state in AS 18.80.255. The legislature also provided for recovery of damages, when appropriate, for state violations of AS 18.80. See AS 22.10.020. The general exceptions to state tort liability that the legislature established in AS 09.-50.250(1) have no control over the specific consent to state liability under the Human Rights Act. Accord Marsh v. Department of Civil Serv., 142 Mich.App. 557, 370 N.W.2d 613, 619 n. 10 (1985) ("Suits against the state for employment discrimination pose no immunity from suit or liability problems since the state . is subject to the provisions [of the state civil rights acts
                ] which . allow actions to be brought in the circuit courts for such discrimination."); State, Dep\'t of Correctional Serv. v. State Div. of Human Rights, 88 A.D.2d 1061, 452 N.Y.S.2d 746, 748 (1982) ("The Legislature, in enacting the Human Rights Law, has waived sovereign immunity to the extent of subjecting the State to the regulations of the law."). The superior court correctly denied the state\'s motion for summary judgment on this point.\nB\nThe superior court found that although the state enjoyed no immunity from claims brought under AS 18.80 and AS 22.10.020(i), the state nevertheless was immune from liability for punitive damages. The surf fishermen argue that the superior court erred. We disagree with the surf fishermen on this aspect of sovereign immunity.\nIn Loomis Elec. Protection Inc. v. Schaefer, 549 P.2d 1341, 1343 (Alaska 1976), we held that "the broad language of AS 22.10.020(c) includes a legislative intent to authorize an award of compensatory and punitive damages for violations of AS 18.-80." We expressed no opinion in Loomis, however, on the specific question of the availability of punitive damages when the state has violated AS 18.80. We believe that the general authorization for damages awards in AS 22.10.020(c) is not sufficient to support an award of punitive damages against the state. On the contrary, government entities may be liable for punitive damages only pursuant to express and specific statutory authority. See Richardson v. Fairbanks North Star Borough, 705 P.2d 454, 456 n. 1 (Alaska 1985) (no punitive damages against municipality without statutory authorization). The superior court correctly determined that the state may not be found liable for punitive damages for violations of AS 18.80.\nIll\nThe superior court determined prior to trial that the Human Rights Commission decision and order should receive no issue preclusive (collateral estoppel) effect. The surf fishermen argue that the superior court erred as a matter of law on this point. According to the surf fishermen, the Commission\'s decision and order became "binding" upon the state when the state failed to appeal that decision and order to the superior court. Thus, the surf fishermen argue, the superior court wrongly permitted the state to relitigate the underlying factual and legal issues actually litigated before the Commission hearing officer. We essentially agree with the surf fishermen\'s argument.\nThere are four basic requirements for the application of issue preclusion: the party against whom preclusion would work must have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the first action, Rapoport v. Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Co., 794 P.2d 949, 951 (Alaska 1990); the issue to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to the issue decided in the first action, id.; the first action must have resolved the issue by final judgment on the merits, id.; and the determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment, Restatement (Second) of Judgments  27 (1982). In Alaska, as in most jurisdictions, issue preclusion may apply to administrative adjudications. Holmberg v. State, Div. of Risk Management, 796 P.2d 823, 825 (Alaska 1990); CFEC v. Byayuk, 684 P.2d 114, 122 (Alaska 1984); Jeffries v. Glacier State Tel. Co., 604 P.2d 4, 8-9 (Alaska 1979). But as we explained in Holmberg, Byayuk and Jeffries, a determination of the appropriate preclusive effect of administrative decisions is possible only on a case by case analysis. Holmberg, 796 P.2d at 825; Byayuk, 684 P.2d at 122; Jeffries, 604 P.2d at 8-9.\nThe question of issue preclusion in this case is somewhat complicated by the statutory scheme of the Human Rights Act. The legislature created concurrent original jurisdiction for actions involving violations of AS 18.80 in both the Commission and in the superior court. Compare AS 18.80.-060(a)(4) & (b)(3); 18.80.100; 18.80.120; 18.-80.130 (Commission jurisdiction, hearing procedure, etc.) with AS 22.10.020(i) (superior court jurisdiction). In an effort to coordinate this double jurisdiction, the legislature also specifically provided for the preclusive effect of the Commission\'s decisions in a few, critical circumstances.\nThe most important preclusion statute for present purposes is AS 18.80.145. Section 145 requires a plaintiff who brings a superior court action under AS 18.80 to serve a complaint on the Commission. Section 145(a). The statute further provides authority for the Commission to intervene in the superior court action or to request the superior court to defer its proceedings for up to forty-five days or such extended period as the court may allow. Id. The statute then states:\nIf within the [deferral] period allowed the commission conducts a hearing and reaches a decision under AS 18.80.120 and 18.80.130, the decision of the commission is binding on the parties to the court action as to all issues resolved in the hearing but not as to any issues not resolved in the hearing.\nId. at (b).\nIn essence, AS 18.80.145 provides a mechanism by which the Commission and the superior court may avoid jurisdictional conflict over actions brought under AS 18.80. In the present case, because of the procedural pace of the two parallel actions, the Commission spent some two years processing, investigating, hearing, and deciding its action. In that time, the superior court action did not proceed beyond the initial pleading stage, and the Commission had no need to intervene or to request deferral under AS 18.80.145. As a result, the language in  145 that establishes the "binding" effect "of all issues resolved" in a Commission hearing does not apply directly to this case. No language in  145, however, suggests that issue preclu sion can obtain only when the Commission has requested deferral. On the contrary, section 145 simply makes clear that Commission decisions and orders rendered within the deferral period must receive issue preclusive effect. Such a deferential scheme clearly suggests that the Commission\'s decisions should carry issue preclu-sive effect in an appropriate case. See Holmberg, 796 P.2d at 825.\nOf course, our general conclusion that the Commission\'s findings should carry preclusive effect when appropriate does not decide the concrete question of whether the superior court properly should have accorded preclusive effect to the particular Commission findings relevant here. The preclusive use of prior administrative findings must always be fair. Byayuk, 684 P.2d at 122. Fairness, at a minimum, requires that the administrative procedure entailed "the essential elements of adjudication." Id.; see also Holmberg, 796 P.2d at 825 (citing 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure  4475, at 764-65 (1981)). Additionally, the doctrine of issue preclusion "is at its best as it applies to an adjudication of past facts, where the second proceeding involves the same claim or the same transaction." Jeffries, 604 P.2d at 9 (quoting 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise  18.-03, at 559 (1958)). However, most courts accord the same preclusive effect to administrative adjudications of legal issues as they do to judicial adjudications of those issues. E.g., Guild Wineries & Distilleries v. Whitehall Co., 853 F.2d 755, 758-59 (9th Cir.1988); Eilrich v. Remas, 839 F.2d 630, 634 & n. 2 (9th Cir.1988); see also 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise  21:2, at 49 (2d ed. 1983); Restatement (Second) of Judgments  27 & 83 (1982).\nIn this case, the Commission adjudicated and resolved numerous issues of law and fact that, if given preclusive effect, would have altered the superior court\'s entire approach to the case. The Commission\'s most notable factual finding was that Alex Brogle\'s "recommendations formed the basis for official actions, and his prejudice infected the entire process." This was, in essence, a finding that intentional discrimination against the surf fishermen on the basis of race played a significant part in the state agencies\' decisions to regulate the surf fishery. The Commission\'s most significant legal conclusion, of course, was that the state had discriminated against the surf fishermen because of race, and thus had violated AS 18.80.255.\nWe conclude that a determination on each of these issues was essential to the Commission\'s decision. We also conclude that it would have been fair to accord those determinations preclusive effect. Regulations that govern the Commission\'s hearing and prehearing procedures clearly provide for the essential elements of adjudication. Indeed, the state does not suggest that the proceedings before the Commission failed to provide a full and fair adjudication of the issues important here. Moreover, examination of the hearing officer\'s remarka bly thorough decision indicates that adjudication of all important issues was exhaustive. The state could have appealed the Commission decision, but chose not to. Thus, following the reasoning of our prior cases in this area, we hold that the superior court erred by not according preclusive effect to the Commission\'s findings and conclusions. The superior court should not have addressed the question of the state\'s violation of AS 18.80.255. The superior court should have focused solely on the damages issues in the ease that were not determined by the Commission, or that, if determined by the Commission, were not essential to the Commission\'s judgment. See Byayuk, 684 P.2d at 122; Jeffries, 604 P.2d at 8-9; 4 K. Davis, supra,  21:2 at 49; Restatement (Second) of Judgments  27 & 83 (1982).\nIV\nThe parties in this case focused on the issue of special, economic damages for lost profits. It is not particularly clear whether the parties also tried issues of general, compensatory damages. The superior court concluded that the surf fishermen had failed to prove, with reasonable certainty, that they had suffered lost profits. The superior court\'s decision contains findings of fact related to the surf fishermen\'s claims for general damages. The superior court decision, however, does not contain any express conclusion as to the availability of general compensatory damages nor does it expressly deny them to the surf fishermen.\n"[A
                ] determination of damages by the trial court is a finding of fact which will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous." State v. Guinn, 555 P.2d 530, 544-45 (Alaska 1976). We have reviewed the record in this case and, we do not find clear error in any of the superior court\'s factual findings. However, we do not limit our review of the superior court\'s damages decision to simply an evidentiary review. "[T
                ]his court will also intervene when the trial court\'s calculations are in disregard of a rule of law pertaining to damage measures." Id. at 545. In the present case, we find that the superior court improperly applied the law governing lost profits damages and general compensatory damages. We review each error in turn.\nA\nObviously, the superior court\'s authority to order any relief for violations of AS 18.80, "including the payment of money" encompasses the authority to award special damages for lost profits. AS 22.10.020; see also Loomis, 549 P.2d at 1343. We previously have held that damages for lost fishing profits, although impossible to prove with mathematical precision, are recoverable if proved with "reasonable certainty." Williams v. Eckert, 643 P.2d 991, 996 (Alaska 1982) (quoting Reefer Queen Co. v. Marine Construction & Design Co., 73 Wash.2d 774, 440 P.2d 448, 452-53 (1968)). Reasonable certainty requires a showing of actual loss of profits and a reasonable basis upon which to compute an award. Id.; see also Alaska Children\'s Serv., Inc. v. Smart, 677 P.2d 899, 902 (Alaska 1984) ("Generally, once the existence of lost profits is established, the actual amount need not be proven exactly."). The superior court explicitly found that the surf fishermen had failed to show either that the state\'s acts or omissions caused them any lost profits or the extent of any lost profits. We disagree.\nThe state concedes that it restricted access to the surf fisheries in order to prevent fishermen, including the plaintiffs, from catching as many salmon as they otherwise would have caught. This case is controlled by the Commission\'s determination that the state\'s restrictions illegally discriminated against the surf fishermen. Thus, any fishing profits that the surf fishermen would have earned if the state had not illegally discriminated against them are, if proved, recoverable. Accordingly, any surf fishermen who can show that he would have fished in the restricted areas during the illegally restricted periods has proved the bare fact of actual lost fishing opportunity. The only remaining question is whether there is a reasonable basis upon which to calculate the extent to which lost opportunity caused lost profits.\nAs we explained in Williams, we will not deny recovery unless the best available evidence on damages provides "no possibility of a reasonably proximate estimation" of lost fishing profits. Williams, 643 P.2d at 996 (quoting Pacific Steam Whaling Co. v. Alaska Packers Ass\'n, 138 Cal. 632, 72 P. 161, 163 (1903)). In the present case, the surf fishermen\'s expert witness offered alternative methods for gauging the amount of fish that the surf fishermen would have caught if the surf fishery had not been closed. The superior court rejected both of the expert\'s methods as unreliable. We agree with this aspect of the court\'s decision.\nUsing his first method of gauging lost profit, the surf fishermen\'s expert calculated the percentage of the total fishery catch in 1979 that the surf fishermen took and then attributed the remaining percentage to the inriver fishermen. The expert then assumed that the inriver fishermen caught similar percentages of the available catch in the years 1980 to 1983. From those projections, the expert estimated the catch that the surf fishermen would have taken during the period from 1980 to 1983. The product of that calculation was an aggregate loss of $1,070,091. The expert\'s second method of estimating damages began with the assumption that the inriver fishermen took all of the available harvest in 1980-83. The expert then multiplied the inriver totals from 1980-83 by the percentage of total harvest that the surf fishermen took in 1979. The product of that calculation was $688,814.\nThe superior court had a variety of reasons for rejecting both of the expert\'s projections. We find the following rationale dispositive: The salmon runs, the size of permissible gear, the length of season openings, and the total number of fishermen at the surf and inriver fisheries all fluctuated from 1979 to 1983. Consequently, the percentage of total harvest that the surf fishermen took in 1979 has no rational correlation to the percentages of the total that they would have taken in the surf from 1980 to 1983. We thus find no error in the superior court\'s decision to reject the surf fishermen\'s calculations of aggregate lost profits.\nThe superior court\'s decision to reject the surf fishermen\'s individual showings of lost profits, however, is not as convincing. It is in this aspect of the decision that the superior court improperly ignored "a rule pertaining to damage measures." Guinn, 555 P.2d at 545.\nWhen the crux of a case is that the defendant\'s acts prevented the plaintiff from fishing during a definite period in certain waters, the harvest that other fishermen took during that period in those waters may provide a reasonable basis upon which to determine an individual plaintiff\'s loss. See Williams, 643 P.2d at 996; West v. Whitney-Fidalgo Seafoods, Inc., 628 P.2d 10, 17 (Alaska 1981). Similarly, the plaintiff\'s own harvests in the period proximate to the lost time period may provide a reasonable basis to establish lost profits. See Williams, 643 P.2d at 995-96. Naturally enough, both types of evidence may work together to provide a reasonable calculus. See id.; Reefer Queen, 440 P.2d at 451-53. Evidence of prevailing conditions (i.e., the numbers of fish available for harvest, the probable effect of intervening weather, the impact of increased competition, the competence of the plaintiff or crew seeking damages etc.) also may play a part in such a calculation. E.g., Williams, 643 P.2d at 995-96; Berg v. General Motors Corp., 87 Wash.2d 584, 555 P.2d 818, 824-25 (1976); Reefer Queen, 440 P.2d at 451. And finally, while most of the cases on this point involve lost fishing time as a result of harm to, or detention of, a vessel, the same principles apply when the plaintiff loses fishing time because of wrongful exclusion from fishing grounds. Williams, 643 P.2d at 996 (citing Pacific Steam Whaling Co. v. Alaska Packers\' Ass\'n, 138 Cal. 632, 72 P. 161 (1903)).\nAs the superior court\'s findings of fact show, most of the surf fishermen presented precisely the sort of evidence that courts generally find sufficient to support an award for lost fishing profits. The superi- or court\'s findings of fact in regard to the surf fishermen\'s activity in the East Alsek surf fishery during the restricted years is particularly thorough. The court found that every surf fisherman fished at least one year between 1980 and 1983 during the restricted opening at the East Alsek river. At least three surf fishermen fished there during every season between 1980 and 1983. Because the Alsek\'s surf fishery was more stringently restricted than the East Alsek\'s, few surf fishermen worked at the Alsek between 1980 and 1983 and the superior court\'s findings are less definite. The superior court did find that ten of the thirteen surf fishermen actually fished in the Alsek surf in 1980, during the limited time that the fishery was open. After 1980, however, it appears that very few surf fishermen attempted to exploit the restricted open area and time at the Alsek surf.\nTaking the easiest problem of calculation first, along with other factors, the superior court could have calculated an individual\'s lost catches on days of discriminatory closure in a given year according to that individual\'s actual catches on days when the particular fishery was open in that year. Cf. Williams, 643 P.2d at 995-96. Upon remand, then, the superior court shall reexamine the present record and employ each surf fisherman\'s individual proof of surf harvest during any given year as a basis for calculating lost profits for that year.\nA closer question is whether the superior court also should use the harvests of fishermen who worked in the surf from 1980 to 1983 as the basis to calculate lost profits in any given year for those plaintiffs who did not fish in the surf in that year. As noted, the harvest that other fishermen take during a definite period in particular waters may provide a reasonable basis upon which to determine lost fishing profits for the same period and waters. See Williams, 643 P.2d at 996. Additionally, we note that some of the surf fishermen testified that they did not bother to fish the surf at the Alsek river mouth during the years of closure because they did not know the area was open to fishing. The superior court\'s analysis of this theory of damages is both incomplete and incorrect.\nWe conclude that, upon remand, the superior court must scrutinize the record for evidence relevant to the lost profit claims of surf fishermen who chose not to fish in either of the two discriminatorily closed fisheries because of the discriminatory closures. If the superior court finds that the state\'s discriminatory restrictions constituted a cause of the choice not to fish at all in a given season or opening, then the court shall calculate, as appropriate, lost profits damages for those fishermen based upon the actual catches of fishermen who worked during the same periods in the same fishery. Cf. Williams, 643 P.2d at 996; see also West, 628 P.2d at 17 (approving calculation of lost fishing profits based on nearby catches in same period). The court, if necessary, may calculate an average actual catch and assign it to those who did not fish. The court also may consider evidence tending to show the skill and capability of each individual in relation to others when making these calculations.\nFinally, we must consider whether the superior court has any basis on which to calculate lost profits due to the Alsek surf restrictions during 1983, when no surf fisherman exploited the area. Initially, we are loath to deny recovery for that season simply because the state\'s discriminatory closures were so effectively daunting to the surf fishermen. To do so would ignore settled principles of damage measure. See C. McCormick, Handbook on the Law of Damages  27(b), at 101 (1935) ("Where the defendant\'s wrong has caused the difficulty of proof of damage, he cannot complain of the resulting uncertainty."). More important, however, to do so would countermand the legislative intent to provide complete relief for violations of AS 18.80. Loomis, 549 P.2d at 1343 (citing AS 22.10.-020).\nAs noted, the best proof available on the Alsek surf fishery comes from 1980, when ten surf fishermen worked there. We have held that the unlawfully restricted catches of that year may provide the basis for determining what lawfully restricted catches would have been that year. We also hold that the catches of that year may provide the basis for determining what the catches would have been in 1983.\nB\nUnder most state antidiscrim-ination or civil rights statutes, compensatory damages awards may include actual damages for mental anguish. Such mental anguish damages, as creatures of statute, are entirely distinct from damages for emotional distress available under common law tort theories, which normally require a showing of extreme mental injury. E.g., Dean v. Municipality of Metropolitan, 104 Wash.2d 627, 708 P.2d 393, 400-01 (1985); Chomicki v. Wittekind, 128 Wis.2d 188, 381 N.W.2d 561, 566-67 (App.1985) (noting that plaintiff had not satisfied common-law tort requirement of "extreme disabling emotional response" but affirming award of mental anguish damages because plaintiff brought action under state antidis-crimination statute, not under common-law theory).\nExamination of the Human Rights Act and of our cases interpreting the Act make it clear that damages for mental anguish are available in Alaska as a form of compensatory damages under AS 22.10.020. Under the Act, the Commission\'s powers to remedy violations of AS 18.80 are quite specific. In all cases, the Commission may "order the person to refrain from engaging in the discriminatory conduct." AS 18.80.130(a). In employment discrimination cases, the Commission may order "any appropriate relief, including but not limited to" reinstatement and backpay. AS 18.80.130(a)(1). And in housing discrimination cases, the Commission may order the sale, lease or rental of housing to the complainant and, also, "may award actual damages." AS 18.80.-130(a)(2). In all cases, however, the Commission\'s power to award money is limited to special damages or to money payments incident to equitable relief, that is, to damages for "direct, calculable pecuniary loss, such as back pay or housing expenses." McDaniel v. Cory, 631 P.2d 82, 88 (Alaska 1981).\nIn contrast, AS 22.10.020(i) (formerly subdivision (c)), provides that the superior court "may enjoin any act, practice or policy which is illegal under AS 18.80 . and may order any other relief, including the payment of money, that is appropriate." (Emphasis added.) Plainly, the remedial powers that this statute grants to the superior court are broader than the specific powers that AS 18.80.130 grants to the Commission. Indeed, the extraordinary difference between remedies available before the Commission and remedies available before the court provides the only rational reason for affording complainants\' new action in superior court after they have prevailed before the Commission. See, e.g., AS 18.80.145.\nWe held in McDaniel that the Commission could not award damages for pain and suffering. McDaniel, 631 P.2d at 86-88. We then added, "should the complainant wish to recover damages from the respondent, recourse to the courts is always available." Id. at 88. In Loomis, we explained that when complainants took recourse in the courts for violations of AS 18.80, among the full range of remedies available to them would be awards of general compensatory damages. Loomis, 549 P.2d at 1343. We wrote:\nThe language of [AS 22.10.020(c)] is clearly intended to provide a litigant complete relief in an appropriate case. In view of the strong statement of purpose in enacting AS 18.80, and its avowed determination to protect the civil rights of all Alaska citizens, we believe that the legislature intended to put as many "teeth" into this law as possible. We fail to see how, consistent with that purpose and intent, the legislature could have contemplated a statutory scheme that would not have included the right to recover damages. Otherwise, there would be many cases in which no meaningful relief would be available to the injured party, the one whose civil rights have been violated and whom the law seeks to protect. We believe that the broad language of AS 22.10.020(c) indicates a legislative intent to authorize an award of compensatory and punitive damages for violations of AS 18.80, in addition to the equitable remedies such as enjoining illegal employment activities and ordering back pay as a form of restitution.\nId. (footnotes omitted). In Loomis, we also indicated in dicta that among the compensatory damages available for violations of AS 18.80 are damages "to redress mental suffering and other intangible injuries." Id. at 1344 n. 12 (quoting Comment, Implying Punitive Damages in Employment Discrimination Cases, 9 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 325, 336 (1974)). We apply that rule today. We also clarify it.\nAs we noted in McDaniel, some states permit the administrative commissions charged with enforcing civil rights statutes to award compensatory damages. McDaniel, 631 P.2d at 87-88. Other states permit only the courts to award such damages. See id. at 88 (citing Iron Workers Local No. 67 v. Hart, 191 N.W.2d 758, 767-68 (Iowa 1971)). Generally, however, all of these states limit recovery of compensatory damages for mental anguish to "actual damages" — that is, to "all those damages directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the injury in question." Mitchell v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., 883 F.2d 451, 453 (6th Cir.1989); accord Brewster v. Martin Marietta Aluminum Sales, Inc., 145 Mich.App. 641, 378 N.W.2d 558, 569 (1985).\nWe agree that compensatory damages for mental anguish caused by discrimination must be limited to actual damages. We also stress that such damages are not to be presumed. See State v. Haley, 687 P.2d 305, 320-21 (Alaska 1984), (presumptive damages are not available for violations of civil rights); Cullen v. Nassau County Civil Serv. Comm\'n, 53 N.Y.2d 492, 442 N.Y.S.2d 470, 473, 425 N.E.2d 858 (1981) (no mental anguish damages "solely upon finding that a discriminatory act occurred"). A complainant\'s own testimony may establish the fact and the quantum of damages. Cullen, 442 N.Y.S.2d at 473, 425 N.E.2d 858. But the amount of mental anguish damages assessed must specifically compensate only the injury proved. Id.\nThe surf fishermen\'s complaint in this case requested general compensatory damages, and the surf fishermen\'s proof at trial included evidence that the state\'s violation of AS 18.80.255(1) had caused at least some of the surf fishermen mental anguish. Walter Johnson formally presented evidence that he suffered emotional injury as a result of the state\'s actions. Other surf fishermen less formally offered evidence that they suffered emotional injury. For example, Sheldon James testified that the closure of the Alsek surf fishery in 1980 surprised, angered, and upset him. He also testified that circum stances surrounding the surf closure — for example, the more lenient restrictions on inriver fishermen and the insulting manner in which Alex Brogle explained the state\'s action to the surf fishermen — convinced him of the racial animus behind the restrictions. Our examination of the record reveals similar testimony from several of the surf fishermen. Yet, the superior court failed to address the question of actual mental anguish damages.\nWe are mindful that the surf fishermen have not extensively, perhaps even competently, briefed the question of mental anguish damages. Nonetheless, we consider their general point on appeal challenging the superior court\'s damage award, in combination with the argument in their brief, sufficient to warrant our ruling on the issue. See Ratcliff v. Security Nat\'l Bank, 670 P.2d 1139, 1141 n. 4 (Alaska 1983). On the other hand, the surf fishermen do not argue that the superior court denied them an opportunity to introduce evidence of mental anguish injury. And, as noted, we find that the surf fishermen did adduce substantial evidence of such injury at the bench trial. Hence, we do not remand for a new trial on this question. Rather, upon remand, the superior court shall determine from the present record whether or not any of the plaintiffs tried the issue of mental anguish damages and, if so, whether such damages were proven.\nThe judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part and MODIFIED in part, and this case is REMANDED for a redetermination of damages based on the present record.\n. White fishermen who work in the region do not fish in the surf. The sole white fisherman identified as ever having fished in the surf in the Yakutat region was Dolph Hensley, whose wife was a Yakutat native. TIingit fishermen testified that Hensley had been accepted as a member of the Native community.\n. Nominally, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fish and Wildlife Protection, is in charge of law enforcement, including enforcement of fishing regulations, in the Alsek and East Alsek area. Unavailability of personnel, however, has constrained the department to forgo some enforcement responsibilities and to delegate others to the Department of Fish & Game officials who work on-site at the fisheries during salmon season.\n. See generally Kenai Peninsula Fisherman\'s Coop. Ass\'n v. State, 628 P.2d 897, 902-03 (Alaska 1981).\n. AS 16.05.251.\n. See AS 16.05.050; AS 16.05.060; see also AS 44.17.-005; 44.17.030.\n. A decline in harvests at other fisheries in the region was one reason Yakutat fishermen turned to the Alsek and East Alsek area in the 1970s. Another reason for the increase in surf fishermen was an improvement in equipment. There is no road from Yakutat to the fishery, so the Tlingit surf fishermen must make the fifty-mile open ocean trip south in their skiffs. Most surf fishermen only somewhat recently obtained the sort of boats and powerful motors that make the journey with ease. The improved equipment also enhanced the surf fishermen\'s effectiveness in the difficult Alsek and East Al-sek surf.\nAs in prior years, the inriver fishermen employed threats of violence, including gunshots, to insure that none of the new surf fishermen moved upstream. The inriver fishermen also apparently hoped that their belligerence would reverse the general increase of competition in the area by chasing some of the new surf fishermen away from the area entirely.\n. A surge in activity in 1973 and 1974 was probably due to anticipation of the limited entry program. The Department responded to the 1974 increase by limiting open fishing time from four to two days per week. Coincidentally, the device Canadian regulators used to measure escapement on the Alsek — a fish "weir"— was not in operation until 1976. Thus, the Department did not have detailed escapement data available for a predictive analysis of the 1979 salmon run on the Alsek. Instead, the Department\'s historical data mainly consisted of records showing the number of fishermen on the Alsek in 1974 and the size of the catch that year.\n. The Board did not widely advertise the meeting, nor did the Board intend the meeting to be a public hearing on the immediate problem of regulating the Alsek fishery. Nonetheless, the question of regulating fishing on the Alsek for the 1980 season dominated the public meeting.\n. Neither the record nor the briefs explain why the superior court action remained suspended while the Commission proceedings ran their course.\n. The state also has appealed the superior court\'s use of a disparate impact model of discrimination in the case, and the superior court\'s refusal to enter directed verdict for the state. Because of our disposition of other issues in the appeal, we do not reach either of these points in the cross appeal. As we note below, however, we in no way intend to endorse either the Commission\'s or the superior court\'s use of the disparate impact model of discrimination in this case. See infra note 22.\n. A grant of partial summary judgment is always reviewable on appeal when final judgment in a case comes after trial. E.g., Currington v. Johnson, 685 P.2d 73, 76-78 (Alaska 1984). Denials of summary judgment also may be reviewable on appeal when final judgment in a case comes after trial, but only if the facts applicable to the summary judgment ruling were not in dispute and the basis of the ruling is a matter of law. Kentucky, Trans. Cabinet, Bureau of Highways v. Leneave, 751 S.W.2d 36, 37 (Ky.App.1988); Shisler v. Fireman\'s Fund Ins. Co., 87 Or.App. 109, 741 P.2d 529, 532 (1987); see also City of Fairbanks v. Schaible, 375 P.2d 201, 206 (Alaska 1962); City of Fairbanks v. Schaible, 352 P.2d 129, 130-31 (Alaska 1960); see generally Annotation, Reviewability of Order Denying Motion for Summary Judgment, 15 A.L.R.3d 899, 902, 922-24 (1967).\n. The state also argues that a fourth statute, AS 44.62.300, preempts any other action against the state\'s use of its regulatory powers. We find no merit in this argument. AS 44.62.300 establishes standing for any "interested person" to "get a judicial declaration on the validity of a regulation by bringing an action for declaratory relief in the superior court." AS 44.62.300. First, the Department\'s emergency order in 1980 "is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62)." AS 16.05.060(c). Second, the Board\'s regulations in subsequent years presumably are subject to challenge under AS 44.62.300. Such a challenge, however, might have alleged that the Board\'s regulations were invalid because they violated AS 18.80.255. See AS 44.62.020 ("To be effective, each regulation adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law") (emphasis added). The surf fishermen did not make such a challenge, preferring instead to seek the remedies for violation of AS 18.80.255 that the legislature explicitly has made available under AS 22.10.020(i). The state does not argue that the legislature impermissibly provided concurrent bases for challenging illegal state discrimination. Thus, the state\'s invocation of AS 44.62.300 is irrelevant to this case.\n. In other words, an action brought under AS 18.80 is not subject to the same rules as one brought under AS 09.50.250.\n. The superior court determined this legal issue by denying the surf fishermen\'s motion for summary judgment. We review the superior court\'s decision on this point de novo. See supra note 11.\n. Another statute addressing the question of preclusion provides that "[t
                ]he acquittal of a person by the commission or a court of competent jurisdiction of any alleged violation of this chapter is a bar to any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same act or omission." AS 18.80.280. This statute establishes a type of claim preclusive effect for particular decisions under AS 18.80 adverse to the claimants or plaintiffs. We note that no statute specifically creates claim preclusive effects when the complainants or plaintiffs prevail. Indeed, when (as in this case) claimants before the Commission prevail, their claim does not merge into the favorable judgment. Rather, they are still free to bring subsequent action under AS 22.10.-020(i) (formerly (c)) in superior court, because the remedies available in court are different than those available before the Commission. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments  83(3) (1982).\n. The state directs our attention to subdivision (d) of AS 18.80.145, which provides that "[i
                ]f the commission does not intervene or file a certificate [i.e., request court deferral
                ] and conduct a hearing as provided in this section, the court has complete jurisdiction of the case, notwithstanding the provisions of AS 18.80.280." The state argues that this language limits the preclu-sive effect of an agency decision to cases in which the Commission intervenes or requests superior court deferral. What AS 18.80.145(d), taken together with AS 18.80.280, means is that where the Commission does not intervene but acquits an alleged violator, that acquittal should not be given preclusive effect in court. This provision is favorable to victims of discrimination, as they are given a second chance in court. However, it would be reading too much into the term "complete jurisdiction" to infer the converse proposition that those found guilty by the Commission are also to be given a second chance in court. Issue preclusion, or more broadly, res judicata, is applicable only where there is dual jurisdiction, that is where two separate forums have complete jurisdiction. Where only one forum has the power to act the term "exclusive jurisdiction" is used. We therefore conclude that  145(d) does not mean that issue preclusion is inapplicable to cases where the Commission does not intervene under  145(a) but determines that discrimination has taken place.\n. The essential elements of adjudication include adequate notice to persons to be bound by the adjudication, the parties\' rights to present and rebut evidence and argument, a formulation of issues of law and fact in terms of specific parties and specific transactions, a rule of finality specifying the point in the proceeding when presentations end and a final decision is rendered, and any other procedural elements necessary for a conclusive determination of the matter in question. Restatement (Second) of Judgments  83(2) (1982).\n. We also note that the statute in the Human Rights Act that addresses the issue preclusive effect of some Commission decisions states that parties shall be bound "as to all issues resolved in the hearing." AS 18.80.145(b) (emphasis added). The statute makes no distinction between issues of law and issues of fact.\n. The superior court, in contrast, found that Alex Brogle\'s racism did not significantly contribute to the state agencies\' official actions.\n. See, e.g., 6 AAC 30.415 (subpoena power); 6 AAC 30.430 (requirement of notice to parties); 6 AAC 30.440 (hearing procedures); 6 AAC 30.460 (rules of evidence); 6 AAC 30.470 (requirement of findings of fact and conclusions of law); 6 AAC 30.480 (provisions for final Commission order); see also 6 AAC 30.510-590 (discovery procedures).\n. The state does perfunctorily note that the Board of Fisheries was not originally named as a respondent in the proceedings before the Commission. The Board of Fisheries, however, was joined in the action before the hearing officer rendered her decision. Moreover, the record indicates that the state acquiesced to joinder of the Board of Fisheries because the joinder posed no threat of prejudice. And finally, the hearing officer\'s decision specifically bound the Board of Fisheries. The Board of Fisheries thus appears to have been a party to the Commission proceedings for purposes of application of issue preclusion. The state makes no express argument to the contrary.\n. Our decision on this point renders unnecessary a review of the state\'s argument that the superior court erred by analyzing this case under the disparate impact model. Our decision that the Commission\'s legal determinations should have received preclusive effect, however, in no way endorses either the Commission\'s conclusion or the superior court\'s .conclusion that the disparate impact model of discrimination correctly applied in this case.\nFirst, we have never approved the use of the disparate impact model outside the context of employment discrimination. See Thomas v. Anchorage Tel. Util., 741 P.2d 618, 628-29 (Alaska 1987) (adopting disparate impact model for cases arising under AS 18.80.220). We recognize that courts and legislatures carefully have extended the use of the disparate impact model beyond the employment discrimination context. See generally Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 666 & n. 9, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 2129 & n. 9, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (listing examples of congressional extension of disparate impact model); Maltz, The Expansion of the Role of the Effects Test in Antidiscrimination Law: A Critical Analysis, 59 Neb.L.Rev. 345, 357-62 (1980). But courts and legislatures also have limited use of the model. E.g., General Building Contractors Ass\'n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 389-91, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3149-50, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982); Larry v. White, 929 F.2d 206, 209 & n. 8 (5th Cir.1991); Minn.Stat.Ann.  363.03(11) (West 1991) (state human rights act adopting use of disparate impact model for employment discrimination only). The issue, then, is problematic, and one that deserves much more consideration than either the Commission or the superior court afforded it in this case.\nSecond, on the specific facts of this case, the disparate impact model appears to have been invoked inappropriately. This was the rarest of all discrimination cases: a case in which the complainants offered strong direct evidence of discriminatory intent. See Wise v. Mead Corp., 614 F.Supp. 1131, 1134 (M.D.Ga.1985) ("It is difficult — if not impossible — for a plaintiff to produce direct evidence of discriminatory intent."). Cases in which the plaintiff adduces direct evidence of motive invoke an entirely different analysis than other cases. A defendant in such a case can only successfully defend by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the same decision would have been reached even without the discrimination factor. EEOC v. Beverage Canners, Inc., 897 F.2d 1067, 1071 (11th Cir.1990); Fields v. Clark Univ., 817 F.2d 931, 936 (1st Cir.1987). This analysis — or model — for cases in which direct evidence of discrimination is present finds its greatest development in employment discrimination cases. E.g., Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). However, courts actually imported the model from outside the employment discrimination context. See, e.g., Fields, 817 F.2d at 936; see also Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563-64, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (under constitutional version of the model, direct proof of discriminatory motive invokes strict scrutiny). Clearly, then, use of the direct evidence model is not limited in the same way that use of the disparate impact model may be limited.\n. In addition to their cause of action under the Human Rights Act, the surf fishermen attempted to assert in the superior court causes of action for damages under the state and federal constitutions. The superior court held that under the circumstances of this case, no implied constitutional cause of action was available. The surf fishermen have appealed only the superior court\'s ruling on their state constitutional claim. We agree with the superior court that the surf fishermen have not shown why an implied constitutional cause of action for damages against the state is either necessary or appropriate in this case. Vest v. Schafer, 757 P.2d 588, 598 & n. 38 (Alaska 1988); see also King v. Alaska State Hous. Auth., 633 P.2d 256, 260-61 & n. 5 (Alaska 1981).\n. See Williams, 643 P.2d at 995 (detention of plaintiffs boat for part of the fishing season left only question of reasonable basis for calculation of damages); West v. Whitney-Fidalgo Seafoods, Inc., 628 P.2d 10, 17 (Alaska 1981).\n. The Department of Fish and Game\'s records first separated surf and inriver harvests in 1979.\n. One of the superior court\'s objections to the surf fishermen\'s second estimate of total damage was that the expert included no account of the plaintiffs mitigation of damages in 1980-83. The court\'s application of the law was clearly wrong on this point. It is true that "a wronged party must use reasonable efforts to avoid the consequences of injury done by another." University of Alaska v. Chauvin, 521 P.2d 1234, 1239 (Alaska 1974); see also Alaska Children\'s Services, 677 P.2d at 902; West, 628 P.2d at 18. However, the question of mitigation is entirely independent of the damages question. See Alaska Children\'s Services, 677 P.2d at 902. In this case, analysis of the surf fishermen\'s proof of damages — both in fact and in extent — is the first step. Only after determining damages does the court reduce the damages amount according to the state\'s proof of mitigation or failure to mitigate. See id. at 901-02.\n. One important condition in this case is the need for fishing restrictions. No one disputes that the state had good reason to restrict fishing in general on the Alsek and East Alsek after 1979, so long as the restrictions were not illegally discriminatory. For the purposes of a reasonable calculation, then, the superior court may assume that a nondiscriminatory surf restriction would have paralleled the inriver restriction. In other words, the superior court feasibly may calculate lost profits according to what the surf fishermen would have made if the surf had been open for them to fish during the same periods that the inriver sites were open.\n. The three are Sheldon James, Daryl James, and Myron Johnson.\n. The superior court found that Russell Bogren and Eli Hanlon did not fish in the surf at the Alsek in 1980. While evidence as to Bogren\'s presence at the Alsek in 1980 was conflicting, we cannot say that the court clearly erred in deciding as it did.\n. The court found that Sheldon James fished the Alsek surf in 1980-82, and that his brother Daryl "fished essentially the same openings."\n. As an example of an incorrect inquiry, when addressing plaintiff Daryl James\' claim of lost profits the superior court wrote: "In 1982 and 1983, Daryl James did not fish the Alsek and the preponderance of the evidence does not show that he would have made more than the expenses he did not incur by staying away." The correct inquiry should have been whether James would have made more than his expenses if the surf fisheries had not been discriminato-rily restricted.\nThe superior court also generally overlooked the significance of a plaintiffs choice not to waste his time trying to fish the restricted waters. For example, when addressing Clarence and Bill Milton\'s claim of lost profits, the superior court simply wrote: "They did not sell any Alsek fish after 1980, concentrating instead on the Situk and East [Alsek
                ] rivers in 1981 and 1982. From this record of catches, the court cannot find with reasonable certainty that the Miltons were damaged as a result of the surf closure at the Alsek River." The superior court here obviously ignores the possible methods of calculation available.\n. Any such calculation, of course, is also subject to all qualifying principles that we have mentioned in connection with the measure of damages at the East Alsek surf fishery or at the Alsek surf fishery in 1980-82.\n. E.g., Mitchell v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., 883 F.2d 451, 453 (6th Cir.1989) (statutory provision for "actual damages" authorized compensatory damages for mental anguish) (Kentucky law); Ridenour v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 786 F.2d 867, 869 (8th Cir.1986) (same) (Iowa law); Cripps v. United Biscuit of Great Britain, 732 F.Supp. 844, 846-47 (E.D.Tenn.1989) (same) (Tennessee law); Brewster v. Martin Marietta Aluminum Sales, Inc., 145 Mich.App. 641, 378 N.W.2d 558, 568-69 (1985) (mental anguish damages available in court action); State ex rel. Cooper v. Mower County Social Serv., 434 N.W.2d 494, 499-500 (Minn.App.1989) (administrative agency empowered by statute to award actual damages and mental anguish damages); Andersen v. Exxon Co., 89 N.J. 483, 446 A.2d 486, 496 (1982) (affirming administrative civil rights agency award of mental anguish damages); State, Div. of Human Rights v. County of Onondaga Sheriff\'s Dep\'t, 127 A.D.2d 986, 513 N.Y.S.2d 68 (1987) (affirming administrative human rights agency award of mental anguish damages but reducing award by 50%), aff\'d 71 N.Y.2d 623, 528 N.Y.S.2d 802, 524 N.E.2d 123 (1988); Dean v. Municipality of Metropolitan, 708 P.2d 393, 400-01 (1985) (affirming jury instruction that included mental anguish as aspect of "actual damages" available under state anti-discrimination statute); Chomicki v. Wittekind, 128 Wis.2d 188, 381 N.W.2d 561, 566-67 (App.1985) (affirming jury award of mental anguish damages under state antidiscrimination law and relying, in part, on availability of mental anguish damages in federal actions under the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1866).\n. See Loomis, 549 P.2d at 1343 & n. 9 (noting that federal courts "have characterized back pay as an integral part of an equitable remedy, a form of restitution").\n. The damage awards for mental anguish, stripped of all punitive component, generally are quite moderate in amount. E.g., Mitchell, 883 F.2d at 453-54 (affirming award of $7,500 mental anguish damages under state law where plaintiff drove 20,000 extra miles per year to work at remote locations in an attempt to avoid a racially-biased supervisor); State ex rel. Cooper v. Mower County Social Serv., 434 N.W.2d 494, 499 (Minn.App.1989) (affirming "administrative law judge\'s $2,
                000 award for mental anguish and suffering . based on findings \'showing the turmoil experienced by [complainant
                ] after her [discriminatory
                ] rejection for employment\' "); Department of Human Rights v. Spiten, 424 N.W.2d 815, 819 (Minn.App.1988) (affirming award of $3000 mental anguish damages to woman and her two children for the pain they suffered when refused an apartment because of their race); Andersen, 446 A.2d at 496 (affirming "moderate $500 award for emotional distress" plaintiff suffered when refused a job because of his disability); Gray v. Serruto Builders, Inc., 110 N.J.Super. 297, 265 A.2d 404, 407, 415-16 (1970) (noting that the plaintiff, a man denied an apartment because of his race, was a person of substantial accomplishment and personal strength, and awarding only $500 mental anguish damages); In re Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 119 A.D.2d 672, 500 N.Y.S.2d 800, 801 (1986) (affirming administrative agency award of $5,000 mental anguish damages where employer ignored Jewish employee\'s request to have days off for Sabbath and Holy Days and ordered him to work); Board of Education v. McCall, 108 A.D.2d 855, 485 N.Y.S.2d 357, 358 (1985) (affirming administrative agency award of $5,000 mental anguish award where employer discriminatorily denied complainant promotion because of gender); Weiss v. State, Human Rights Appeal Bd., 102 A.D.2d 471, 477 N.Y.S.2d 342, 345 (1984) (holding that administrative agency abused discretion by not awarding mental anguish damages where employer discriminatorily denied complainant promotion because of gender and awarding $1,000); Chomicki v. Wittekind, 381 N.W.2d 561, 565-67 (Wis.App.1985) (affirming awards of $1,500 economic damages, $7,500 emotional distress damages, and $10,000 punitive damages where landlord treated tenant "as a sexual chattel . and forced [plaintiff
                ] to relocate in middle of winter along with her young children").\nIn fact, the only relatively large award for mental anguish damages under a state antidis-crimination law that we have found was reduced by 50% on appeal because the appellate court found it "grossly excessive." County of Onondaga Sheriff\'s Dep\'t, 513 N.Y.S.2d at 68 (reducing award of $30,000 mental anguish damages to $15,000 where record did not reveal how long complainant suffered depression or other effects after her discriminatory discharge from employment).\n. The surf fishermen argue that the trial court should have awarded them damages for "lost heritage." The surf fishermen, however, articulate what amounts to a presumptive basis for measuring such an award. The surf fishermen are Native Alaskans denied access to the Alsek and East Alsek surf, and surf fishing, according to the Commission decision in the case, is part of the native heritage. Those facts alone, however, do not establish that the surf fishermen suffered "lost heritage" injury. Insofar as any individual plaintiff has shown that part of the mental anguish he suffered was related to his sense of "lost heritage," such loss might enter into the trial court\'s consideration of actual mental anguish damages. The superior court, however, properly will ignore the surf fishermen\'s aggregate claim for lost heritage damages. See Haley, 687 P.2d at 320-21.']
